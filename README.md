## iris-interoperability-template
This is a template of InterSystems IRIS Interoperability solution.
It contains a simple interoperablity solution which reads data from Reddit, filters it and outputs into file or sends via email.

## What The Sample Does

This sample has an interoperability [production](https://github.com/intersystems-community/iris-interoperability-template/blob/master/src/dc/Demo/Production.cls) with an inbound [Reddit Adapter](https://github.com/intersystems-community/iris-interoperability-template/blob/master/src/dc/Reddit/InboundAdapter.cls) which is used by a [Business Service](https://github.com/intersystems-community/iris-interoperability-template/blob/master/src/dc/Demo/RedditService.cls) to read data from Reddit.com.
It reads from reddit.com/new/.json every 15 sec.
You can alter both the URL and frequency in the service's settings.

The production has business pocess with the rule which fiters news which contains mentions of cats and dogs and sends this data into business operation which either saves into source folder /output/Dog.txt or /output/Cat.txt.

Make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [Docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed.

## Installation: ZPM

Open IRIS Namespace with Interoperability Enabled.
Open Terminal and call:
USER>zpm "install interoperability-sample"

## Installation: Docker
Clone/git pull the repo into any local directory

```
$ git clone https://github.com/intersystems-community/iris-interoperability-template.git
```

Open the terminal in this directory and run:

```
$ docker-compose build
```

3. Run the IRIS container with your project:

```
$ docker-compose up -d
```



## How to Run the Sample

Open the [production](http://localhost:52795/csp/irisapp/EnsPortal.ProductionConfig.zen?PRODUCTION=dc.Demo.Production) and start it.

2020-10-29 16:12:22 : Guilt, shame and trauma : lueyforthethrone : https://www.reddit.com/r/widowers/comments/jkcyx2/guilt_shame_and_trauma/

My partner died by suicide in July. He was my first and only love of almost 9 years. He was 28 and I’m 29. The last interactions we had that day, were an argument. The last texts I sent him, the last words I spoke, and I even wrote an unkind hand written note that day because we were arguing the whole day. All of it was mean and I was drunk and I can’t remember exactly what I said. He ended his life while I was home playing with the dog in the kitchen of our apartment. I was playing with her to cheer up, sober up and get ready to forgive and talk to him....but I was too late and I found him in our bedroom. He didn’t die immediately, but he officially passed away a week later in the hospital. I am so destroyed. Not only was it a suicide, but our last interactions of our loving relationship were unkind. I see lots of posts of people looking back at their last texts saying they love each other. Ours were unkind and I have to live with it. He’s gone, my partner of 9 years, my soulmate. I had to move out of our apartment because I couldn’t stay in the place he ended his life. Now I’m back home in my childhood room with family that doesn’t get it.

My siblings don’t ask how I am, even though I only stay in my room and sleep most of the day, my cousins don’t and my friends might check in once a week if I’m lucky. This happened in July, why the fuck do people think I’m ok now, if ever? I witnessed his suicide and I had to walk away from the life we built for 9 years. Nobody gets it and I kind of hate everyone. Nobody I know knows partner loss, much less a suicide, much less one you witnessed. No one understands losing the one and only home you had with your love because they did the deed there. And no one understands the crippling loneliness I now feel. His friends don’t text me anymore, but some post of social media about him. I just don’t understand how people don’t ask how I am. I lost my half, and there is a reason they’re called your half. Our lives were meshed together and we lived parallel to each other. Everyday I talked to him, and almost everyday I saw him. The last 3 years I saw his face everyday. The only person who cared this deeply about me is gone because he couldn’t take this world anymore, and u don’t remember what I said but it didn’t help. And now it feels like I fucking deserve this loneliness, despair and depression. What a miserable existence

2020-11-15 06:40:37 : Any Golden Retriever litters out there? : brochacho88 : https://www.reddit.com/r/santarosa/comments/juhmw3/any_golden_retriever_litters_out_there/

I realize it’s a real long shot but anybody have or know about a Golden litter in the area? 

...and before anyone wants to let us know that we should be rescuing another dog/breed in need, I understand and agree with the sentiment. All of our animals have been rescues or started as fosters (wife works at an vet and we have taken in multiple pets that were released). My wife has always wanted a Golden and I’m trying to make it happen for her! 

Thanks!

My dog, ever since she was a puppy, had a habit of eating her poop. I heard that dogs grow out of it, so I wasn’t concerned and stopped her whenever I could, but I’m growing worried that she already is a compulsive poop eater. I have not used punishments when I see it, I don’t overreact, and I have started giving her supplements that are supposed to deter her from eating poop. She just always slips away, poops, and eats it before we can smell it. It’s also hard to stop her because she doesn’t poop always on schedule. At this point I’m lost and I don’t know how to stop it. Any help or advice is appreciated.

My wife and I are looking for things to do, but obviously most of what you normally do in Vancouver in the Fall is out of the question right now.

Obviously hiking, but is there much else?

The he CD intro/outro is s probably the coolest portrayal of the character in my opinion. How would you feel about it returning?

What I get from the CD intro is that Sonic is a calm, mostly silent, "get-it-done" action hero who is a bit of loner and also has ***subtle*** mannerisms displaying a ***slightly*** cocky attitude ***at times.***  (like the little mannerism he does [here](https://youtu.be/UIWYU3xDcFw?t=71)

He's not like Adventure 2 Sonic, who's a bit more "hyper" and "talkative"" giving lighthearted quips like, "Talk about low budget flights! No food or movies? I'm outta' here! I like running better."

No. Again, he's quiet and observant.

Basically, give Sonic back the qualities he was robbed of by Knuckles and then Shadow.

One post I saw on another subreddit said it pretty well: "I get that giving the character "attitude" appealed to kids in the '90's but its grating and obnoxious. He can be cool because of his abilities, not because he throws out one-liners and eats chili dogs."

2020-11-15 06:44:22 : Coming out story : Cheezichez : https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/juhode/coming_out_story/

I am coming out right now. I looked around and found similar people like me. This is hard for me to do, but it is something I must do. People used to call me weird in school. Give me wet-willies and wedgies for being different. I was even, at one point, forced to kill my dog because a bully didn't think someone with my 'condition' could own a pet. My mother used to give me enemas consisting of bleach, peroxide, and Robitussin to try to cleanse my body of whatever foul demon had possessed her son. Truth be told, I am no demon, I am just a man, a man who may not think like most. I understand that no-one else in this Discord may share my orientation, but that will not deter me from coming out. I am coming out to you guys because I believe you need to know. You have seen signs of it throughout our gaming experiences, for example when I roleplay as Rakan in League of Legends and shared a deep passionate kiss with my Attack Damage Carry who was playing Xayah at the time.  Or when I was playing Brimstone in the popular First Person Shooter game Valorant and I gave Joey and Aaron a sloppy, slobbering, tasty smooch on their lips when I decided to play the character Sage who is also from the popular First Person Shooter game Valorant.  Me coming out is not a sign for you to think of me as a higher being.  Just because I am one of few to come out and tell my story through the highs and the lows is NOT any reason to think of me any better than the normal sheep of society I once was. I am Demi-Bi-Sexual. I know it is a shock to all, but I needed to put it out there and let you all know before we venture down a deeper more intimate path of friendship. Being Demi-Bi-Sexual is alien to most of you and I doubt you have met a similar human such as me. Being Demi-Bi-Sexual means I am Bi-Sexual, with the caveat of only being attracted to one sex. The sex I prefer is female. This Discord, sadly, has no-one that shares my orientation, which wasn't a  surprising find.

##Brisbane the Nincada!
I went into Route 116 hoping to get a Nincada, and it was my first encounter! I really wanted a Ninjask and Shedninja, so I was ecstatic when I found him.

##Grinding ~~and rescuing a dog~~
I caught Brisbane at level 6. SIX. There's going to be a lot of grinding, so I grinded until someone died. A wild Whismur was using Uproar and it did half of Brisbane's health. I couldn't risk running so I switched into Nairobi to try to run. It KO'd her though.  That was the first death of the nuzlocke. After that I stopped grinding and rescued Peeko.

##More Grinding
My Silcoon and Cascoon were both level 9, so why not evolve them? I grinded them until they evolved into Beautifly and Dustox simultaneously. I also leveled them up to learn Gust.

##Dewford Town!
After that long grind, it was time to head to Dewford. I did some last minute grinding and grinded both Sydney and Lima to level 15. It was time for Brawly.

##Gym Battle!
Brawly led with Machop and I led with Sydney. He was an easy 2HKO. Meditite was next, we only needed 3 Gusts to finish it off. Makuhita was a problem. Sydney kept using gust, but Brawly kept using potions. Eventually, I poisoned him and he was at red.



He used reversal. 



Sydney [died](https://imgflip.com/i/4mfzvp).



He had just a sliver of HP left. One more turn would've taken him down and saved Sydney. I switched to Lima and Makuhita [fainted.](http://imgur.com/a/N81nSHP)

My parents adopted a dog. The dog is around 2. He is around 25-30 lbs. 

He is very energetic and jumps a lot. He is also very possessive a toys and constantly steals toys from our other dog (male).  

Although he is fine most of the time and usually loving. He has bitten hands. There is no growling or sign that he will. Sometimes the bites are unprovoked. 

What can we do to curb it? (We have whimpered after, and he looks sad and licks the wound (?))

If you want to send me dog and cat videos, you are at the wrong place, I hate animals.

I haven't watched a single episode of FRIENDS and I still believe from the deepest corner of my heart that HIMYM is sooo much more better.

I love reading crappy sappy romance novels and I can do that for hours.

If you are still reading, I hate anime or gaming too.

I am not a loner with no friends or an introvert too shy to make conversations, you just gotta get past my snark and sarcasm though.

I hate coming out of my comfort zone when it comes to music and new shows, I would play the same main stream 40 songs on loop and watch the reruns of the same shows again and again, because one, I hate experimenting and two, searching something new is too much effort.

Also, I have no idea what I am looking for, so let's decide that together if and when we vibe.

So that's that I guess.

About what I am expecting of you, again, no idea. As overrated and overused this statement is, I am still a little old schooled believing, I don't have a type, if we vibe, we vibe. (Don't be younger than 22 though :P)

Hii lovelies, just to clarify I’m pansexual but I’m seriously looking for friends rn and if it turns or develops into something more then a relationship. Also that I’m okay with people of any age. If you don’t know what pansexual means it means I love everyone of any gender but I really base you on your personality and what you’re like as a person. So if you like to be rude and try to get me to send even though I don’t know you I already don’t like you, and much more like that. So you get the jist that I don’t like rude people lol. 

You also might wanna know about me. I’m about 5’4” or 5’3” I don’t remember but I’m pretty sure I’m short. I am a curvy person who’s still average but very curvy. I’m a mixed baby but I mainly look African American instead of Caucasian. So you probably aren’t into that so I might as well say that right now. I have dark brown eyes, one dimple and my natural hair color is black but I bleached and dyed my hair so right now it’s a blob dish brown that’s really curly right now. My birthday is coming up soon, I’ll be 19 the day after Halloween!Also I love drawing, reading manga and normal books, watching anime, dancing sometimes. Singing to myself when I’m alone (I’m super shy), playing my violin, spending time with family and friends. Loving my pets, sleeping and eating and more. I love ranting about my lovely doggies and love showing pics of my drawings so ask away if you wanna see :). 

I’m fairly shy and an ambivert. I tend to be more introverted when you know me but become like a crazy weird extrovert to only you when we get comfy with one another. Something that I sort of stress on is that I’m very sexual but I gradually want to talk and do that stuff with someone after I’ve gotten to know them since I really don’t feel comfortable when doing that immediately or after a couple of days[.](https://imgur.com/a/zSkoZFz)

For the person who would like to hopefully like to write to me. I hope you’re ready for a bunch of anime/manga recommendations as well as horror movies I love to watch! Especially since it’s closing in on Halloween I’m most likely to want to watch a bunch of horror movies either in person or via video call. (I don’t mind distance for how far a person can be.) 

I have so much more to me than just this. If you wanna know more please send me a chat/message I’d be grateful to get one from you. Hope to chat with you soon 💕💕

P.S. I have an album of my pics/videos hidden within this post! :)

2020-11-15 06:52:31 : Sexually assaulted last night by my little sisters husband : No-Requirement-90 : https://www.reddit.com/r/survivorsofabuse/comments/juhrid/sexually_assaulted_last_night_by_my_little/


I’ve debating posting this, out of fear and embarrassment, but I really don’t know what else to do. I don’t know who to tell, I don’t know how to feel, (other than what I read is normal; sickness, sadness, and on the verge of a stroke) but I do think I need to get this out. And I welcome any advice, but please, if you’re taking the time to read my story- be kind. I’m very fragile right now.

I have 4 sisters. One of them, the oldest, passed away tragically 4 weeks ago today, at 35 years old. However- this post is not about her, but rather a preface to the already tremendous grief I’m dealing with on top of digesting what happened last night. 

This post is about the husband of my younger sister. She is 24. She’s been with her husband for 8 years. They had a shotgun wedding at 18 years old and never looked back. They share 2 children, a mortgage, and are really kind of the pinnacle of our family. Even though she’s younger she’s always kept us together. She’s the cook, the planner, the one who seemingly has all her shit together, the host, the one who will plan your birthday party 8 months in advance- but I digress...

10 years ago my mom made the decision to move across the country. She took said sister (well all of them actually) with her. I was 19 and pregnant at the time, so I stayed where I was on the East Coast, and just raised my daughter there, seldomly seeing my family. I started visiting here (home now) more frequently after the death of my grandparents, and I would sob every time I left. I never wanted to leave. I loved being near my sisters, my aunt and uncle, my niece and nephew, and my brother in law. Leaving was always a punch in the gut. So after 10 years, I finally convinced myself  to make a move to be with them, in Texas. Packed up my dogs, my 9 year old, and my boyfriend and moved out here. 

I’ve been here for 3 months. I’m at her house everyday. I got a place 8 miles from her. Our kids play, we share coffee in the mornings, sometimes we sneak off for an occasional margarita when they’re in bed and our partners are gaming. Anyways, we’re close. So close. Best friends- all of us. One big happy family.

Then after the sudden death of my sister, we became somehow even closer. My brother in law had helpful things to say sometimes, and he helped my sister grieve. He helped pick up some slack. My other younger sister and I have been inseparable. We cry to each other and try to still get through our bachelor Tuesday without bursting into tears. We had to plan funerals (yes two) and have just had each other to lean on with this. It’s been awful, but it was so nice knowing we had each other. All of us. 

Now, this would be my first Holiday season with my family in 10 years. I usually spent them crying in a closet at night back in Tennessee because I missed my family, and was around my boyfriends toxic parents only, but that’s another story. And although this would be our first Christmas without my oldest, and most wonderful sister, it would also be my daughters first Christmas with my family. Ever. Again, she is 9.

So now, into to the incident. 

My brother in law had a brain injury from a football accident in high school. He is doing fine now, and functions well. However, as it’s been explained to me, sometimes he has no filter. Literally says the most insane things sometimes that are either weird, out of line, sometimes funny when he speaks so freely with the excuse of not being able to help it- but it has been problematic at times. We all just try to laugh it off or tell him “not now” or apologize for his unapologetic commentary to those who don’t know. 

In the past few months he’s said some things that are flirty to me. Nothing major. Nothing that I would think anything of my own partner saying to my sister. Like “you’re a pretty girl, of course you’ll get that job” or compliment me in a ton of different ways. But he also recently starting saying some other things. One day he told me he wanted to kiss me. He was kind of drunk, and I just shook my head at him and thought “well, there it is- that brain injury coming out.”...

I dismissed it. I dismiss a lot with him, but I thought this one thing was weird and I did not appreciate it. It was said more than once after that. Or he would say my name in a weird way, I can’t explain it. Sometimes just talk about over sexual stuff. I always greeted it with “stop, x”. And I didn’t want to tell my sister because they’re already having some little marital issues and are in counseling. He comments on her weight sometimes, or hides money, etc. Not the best but not the worst. I figured that adding to it would just hurt her a lot, and dismissed it.

So, last night, after my sister and I had a socially distanced girls dinner (while our guys manned the children and made s’mores by a fire- just peachy)- we got home around 2 a.m. To their house. We decided to stay the night and not wake my daughter. They have a roomy house. This is something we’ve done several times, without any issues. 

My sister went to bed first. Then, my boyfriend (arguably my brother in laws best friend, btw), and it was just me and him. Outside. By a fire. Talking about my passed sister, talking about life, having a normal conversation that got deep at times about his mom being ill, but I didn’t feel any creepiness. No word vomit was happening, no kissing talk. Just two (basically) siblings by a fire as the last ones standing in a late evening.

He appeared drunk, but I have no idea how much he actually had. He’s not a slurring, knocked down kind of drunk. Just gets chatty and a little stumbly. Anyways, I had also had a couple drinks earlier in the night, and decided before bed I wanted to eat a bagel. With cream cheese. So I walked inside as he put out the fire.

He walked in after my moments later and turned off the oven where I was making the bagel. I looked at him, and said “hey, I’m making a bagel leave it on” and turned in back on. Then he turned it off again. And I turned it on. Didn’t know what was up with that. Then, he just kind of grabbed me towards him and said “you don’t need a bagel, come sit on the couch with me” I declined. He then turned off the oven again, grabbed both of my hands and said “Please, come to the couch with me? Let’s just talk a little longer”. I didn’t want to. I wanted to eat a damn bagel and go to bed. It was so late, and I was done talking. 

But then- he pulled me close to him and said “come on- it would be fun”

I asked what would be fun? I said that it was messed up if he was implying what I thought, and that my sister would be so horrified to know he had made that comment at all. I said “go to bed and sleep next to your wife.”

He then pulled me into the hallway. He is a welder by trade and pretty strong, but this was a forceful pull. 

Not knowing what to do, and not wanting to just scream “hey sis wake up, your husband is being a weird pervert to me”, I literally ran away from him and into my sisters bedroom. I laid down next to her. I knew if I was near her he wouldn’t keep saying these things or trying to touch me. 

She woke up, barely, and said what are you doing?? I didn’t have an answer. Her husband followed me into the room and laid on the other side of her. She asked him if he would go lay down on the couch, as my little family was already in the guest room. I think she thought I just wanted to sleep beside her, due to being sad about my sister.

He didn’t move. He laid there with her- as she fell asleep- with me on the other side of her. I gave it a couple minutes. Played dead. Then, when I thought he was asleep or at least not going to follow me out, I briskly walked out of the room and started to go down the hall to go up the stairs, and go to sleep myself. Next to my daughter and boyfriend. 

He all but chased me out of the room, and shut my sisters door. He pulled out his Penis, and grabbed my hand and placed it on it. I was fucking horrified. I must have said stop, no, etc, 15 times while he held my hand there for a few seconds. So disturbing.

While I managed to pull my hand away, and was making toward the stairs, but grabbed me as I was trying to go up. He was physically holding onto me as I tried to pull my way up the rails. 

I finally made it to the top, where there is a guest bathroom. I was wearing a skirt. He forced me into the bathroom and I said stop. Please. Stop. Quietly. Praying my boyfriend would walk out. Just not our kids. As he was trying to wrangle his dick out once more. 

Then, a glass fell off the counter. Made a huge crash, and it stopped him. I played it off like he needed to go take care of that quickly before the kids got up and stepped in any bits that got into the hallway. He agreed and headed downstairs to get a broom. 

I took my opportunity. I. Fucking. Flew. Into the bedroom where my boyfriend was. I shook him awake and said “(brother in law)” is trying to rape me into his ear, so my daughter wouldn’t hear. He hopped out of bed and said “what are you talking about??” 

He stepped out of the bedroom and there he was, sweeping up glass. Boyfriend said “what the fuck is going on?” And I said “ask him”. Brother in law said “I was sleeping and this glass broke.”

I then turned to my kids dad and mouthed to him “please just observe. Please pretend you’re going to bed. Please watch what he’s trying to do”.

I wanted a witness. I have seen this film before, and I knew that when I did eventually tell my sister the next day, I wanted a eye witness. However, boyfriend did not wait. He said that I was accusing him of rape. Brother in law looked bewildered. “What are you TALKING about” he said. “I’ve been asleep with *blank*.”

I said be honest. I was so sad. Felt betrayed and disgusted. I knew he would deny it, of course, but then - my sister wakes up. 

We had made it to the bottom of the stairs by her room and she heard us talking about it. When she asked what was going on, I looked to her husband. He was staring holes in me. He even mouthed “please”, in what I assume meant “don’t tell her.”

But I did. My boyfriend did too. She said “No way, that’s not real.”

I starting crying. I said “Why would I make this up? Why would I shake my boyfriend out of a slumber hysterically. Why do you think I came and laid beside you? Thank god the glass broke, was almost even worse.”

Thank. God. The. Glass. Broke. 

She then walked away to check on her kids while the rest of us stood there, BUT, as she walked back, she caught the tail end of my Brother in Law say 

“Please don’t tell. It will destroy my life” I knew she heard it. 

My daughter then came down the steps sleepy eyed. We acted like nothing was wrong, got my daughters things, and came home. I was anticipating a call from my sister with questions, but got none. Unusual, but I figured they were in the middle of it. 

Then I finally called her. She told me that her husband, who was first denying it all, then told her it happened, but was consensual. Obviously I was outraged. I kept my cool and asked her again, to be logical. Why would I have ran away. Why would I have tried to lay next to her to “protect” me. I even swore on our family, something I believe we all take very seriously at this time. I said he was lying and begged her to remember what she had heard him say. “Don’t tell.”

I imagine it would be bad enough if it was consensual- but to have to come to terms with the fact that your husband is an attempted rapist, to your big sister, is reasonably something you would like to be in denial about. I gave her some time.

Then we got a phone call (my boyfriend and I) Who feels so betrayed by the way. Anyways, on the phone was my brother in law on speakerphone, and he went on about how sorry he was and how much he loved us and our family was his world. He even said, I was out of my mind, I fucked up, I’m not even attracted to you. Ok. Weird but ok. He also said he was done drinking forever. 

Silence from my boyfriend. 
I said I hope we can get past this but I don’t know if we ever can. 


A few minutes later, my sister called back. Just saying she didn’t know what to do.
My youngest sister (yes I know a lot of sisters to keep up with) is up north out of town comforting my mom during this time. I am dog sitting. I asked if she wanted to ride with me. She said yes. I picked her up. 

When she got into the car, I said “how are you?” To which she replied “to be expected.”

I felt that. We mostly rode in silence to her house, with the occasional comment that this was all real fucked up. Even had a laugh or two on how this felt like a bad simulation and wasn’t real.

We took care of the dogs, and went to grab a bite. My sister, who sometimes has a drink with dinner, was taking shots. At a wing restaurant. A lot of shots. The waitress seemed a little concerned, my sister then started crying and told her what happened. The young and very nice girl said that my sis was a bad bitch, to wipe those tears, and that that was a really shitty thing for her husband to do. And with her sister.

She did not know I was the sister. Watching my sister get wrecked, and cry which she literally NEVER does. Not even at the funeral, was hard. I was trying to get us out of there. She just kept drinking. Saying she wanted a divorce, but she felt stuck. Apologizing to me for what happened. Going back and forth between laughing about what a piece of shut her husband was and crying about how this probably wasn't the first time he had done this to someone. 

I finally got her out of there. She was drunk, she was unraveling. She was smoking cigarettes (she doesn’t do that) and just repeating she was not okay. I drove her home. She begged me to take her back to my house but I said just go inside- try to work it out- or get some sleep. If you need me, call me. 

Well she sure called me. She called me and asked me to come get her, and as I was getting redressed to do so, she said never mind. She said she was confused. She said her husband was once again saying it was consensual. That he swore I wanted it. Here we went again. I tried to tell her that was not the case but knew I was talking to a version of her that was so intoxicated it didn’t matter. I realize how hard it must be to accept your husband would do some creepy, betraying shit like that. 

She told me he said my skirt was so short, and that it kept riding up and I didn’t notice. He said he couldn’t help himself. It was the way I was dressed. THEN, just as I was telling my sister I could never look at his face again, he was getting a call that his mom was having a stroke. What the hell. So, he left her alone in the house. With her kids. Wasted and puking in her bathtub, crying to me and just saying she didn’t know what to think. I finally talked her out of the bathroom, and into her bed via phone. 

She then called me and said that my dead sister had just spoken to her in a dream and said that she was not okay with any of this ( older sister didn’t care for brother in law)


This brings me to right now.

She’s sleeping. My partner is being supportive but feels incredibly sad and betrayed himself. What the hell do we do on thanksgiving? What will I tell my daughter when we’re not at aunties every weekend? How do I move past this. Can I? Should I? 

I’m so sad. And I’m mostly sad for my sister.
She asked me not to tell my other siblings or my mother. I agree that would only bring my hurt on my hurting family, but I also feel people need to know. 

I don’t know what there is to do or say, and typically I am forgiving to a fault, but it all hit me when I got home that this wasn’t just a fluke dumb comment. I was sexually assaulted and almost raped. By my trusted brother in law.

I’m so sick, and sad. 
And I know I’m not the only one.

2020-11-15 06:53:14 : Young Joel flashback rumors : North_Pickles : https://www.reddit.com/r/TheLastOfUs2/comments/juhrrh/young_joel_flashback_rumors/

I was watching a YouTube video months ago made by this YouTuber named “Tajae” I believe. Whoever he was, he made TLOU Part II discussion videos and in one of his videos, he showed a screenshot of the cast of Part II on IMDb and if I can remember correctly, there were two or three kids who were set to play Joel as a kid. One of them was to play a 5 year-old Joel, another was a 10 year-old Joel, and the last was a 15 year-old Joel. I forgot what the exact video was called but those two or three kids who were set to play young versions of him was on an IMDb cast page. This was a month or more before the launch so Naughty Dog must’ve scrapped it last minute. It’s a shame we never got young Joel flashbacks, I think we all would’ve loved it.

While waiting for volume 14 to be translated, I have been wondering like how will the series end.

He said that it is not possible for him to lead a normal highschool life anymore but he cannot go all out at once. But the new island exam has given him a oppurtunity. As all of the top dogs of all the three school years are cautious of him and share a competitive vibe with him. And also this is the only exam that has not ended in one volume. I also heard that only half of the special exam has been covered in volume 14. So this might be the major turning point of the series like he going all out. And the main arc becoming Ayano vs Nagumo. This is just my speculation so please do not hate me.

This is where my thoughts get crazy. When they enter the third year either Ayano will pull the Koro sensei card or the theory that all of them graduating as class A like to gather billions of points. For the theory that all of them will graduate as class A, i think it is very good and justified. Because we always get hinted between the interactions with other leaders and ayano that it is a bit unfair like only class A will get the priveleges that the school is known for but the school maybe advertises it as like all of them can get the priveleges as most students enter hoping that. So there must be a way to achieve that or else why will the school do that and so maybe ayano will figure it out. I read another theory that the whole grade will fight against ayano's dad or something.

Which one of these theories is most likely to be true? Let me hear your thoughts about these.

Well like the title says my dog will snap at the other dog when he comes near me. However, this only happens when they’re laying on my bed. Any way to stop this or why he’s doing this?

For example naming a Blacksmith, Smith; a Miner, Miner; a tall person, Tahler; or a fluffy dog; fluffy.

Not a nickname, but an actual name. More so happens in books but it can happen with things in real life as well.

I vaguely feel like it was one of those french phrases like faux pas.

I feel like every single thing I do reminds me of her, what methods do you use to block out those thoughts?

If I cook I wish I cooked for her

I bought a nice coat today, and I instantly thought I would look good in it next to her

A friend took her dog to the vet, It made me remember when my dog died and how she comforted me and a few days later I had my second date with her in which I kissed her for the first time

I try to study and and she pops into my mind, Its hard to focus

sometimes I get bad thoughts as well, of her finding someone new and them being intimate.. I know its not my business yet it still hurts

What do you do to try and suppress those memories and thoughts?

I cant seem to focus on my studies because of it, only for a short length of time

2020-11-15 06:58:22 : SO Awesome.. : alaskansteve : https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservativelifestyle/comments/juhtnf/so_awesome/

For the nervous Nellies out there.  Here is what you need to know.  They CANNOT win, and they CANNOT steal the election.  It is GAME OVER.  100%.   

You can go enjoy your weekend now, rest assured.  For those wanting details, there are plenty.  Let's start with the fact that the anons are ALL over this stuff.  One of the smartest things Q did was pick the venue to post to.  He is beloved by the anons, the most elite hacking and researching group ever assembled.   

For example, the anons discovered a "C" shaped military base in Antarctica by tracking the fitbit data on soldiers who didn't turn on their GPS privacy mode. This is what they DO!  Of all the anons, the top one is CodeMonkey (CM from now on), and if I committed a crime and was asked if there was one person on the planet I didn't want on the case, it would be him.  If I was hiding in a grass hut in Bangladesh, and he learned my middle name, I would be surrounded by military in an hour.  He has been uncovering SO much info it's scary.   

So what now?   Do you remember when I told you Monday or so that the US military raided the Scytl company which counted ballots electronically in Germany and Spain and took their servers?   This was coming from the anons.   Last night Congressman Louis Gohmert confirmed this is the case.  So what did the anons do after verification?  They looked at US Army twitter posts announcing a "training" exercise in Germany on the date of the raid, then went to flight data and found the US Army helicopters likely involved and tracked them going off course to Frankfurt where the server raid took place.  I think they know the name of the pilot's dog at this point.   They are amazing.  

CodeMonkey wasn't done there.  He said the fact that our ballot counting companies are located in Europe, yet we had immediate real time results, proves the election machines were illegally connected to the internet which also means the NSA recorded everything.  CM also noted that the Dominion machines were never validated in Maricopa County AZ, an area heavily for Trump, which means they might have used black box voting machines instead.  

Scytl knows they are in trouble and put out a message proclaiming innocence, then their web site went down, Twitter is banning anyone posting about Scytl, and google is blocking searches for Scytl because this is what you do when you are innocent and have nothing to hide.  

The anons also figured out that Trump cryptically let us know about Scytl on the same day as the military raid in a post riddled with typos that were intentional whose meaning were deciphered by the anons.  Here is the image.   

Need more proof?  Lin Wood is a TREASURE TROVE of info.  If you follow only ONE source during this cycle, his twitter feed should be it.  He said Biden and his criminal cronies won't sleep well after they learn we have Scytl, then added Biden would sleep well because he can't remember Scytl.  Lin Wood also said that Biden would be going to PRISON along with "THOUSANDS” of others.   

You HAVE to remember, only the Trump team has the REAL data, and they are telling you Trump won in a landslide and the Biden people are going to jail.   

Sidney Powell is a close second to Lin Wood in her bluntness and just said she was going to release the Kraken.  (https://youtu.be/iuhUpmo62Hc  skip the first 10 minutes) Sound like people worried about the outcome?   DO NOT PAY ATTENTION to state news sources.  IGNORE local court rulings.   CM has pointed out that ignoring election law equates to voter fraud.  Rulings against Trump by corrupt local courts are MEANINGLESS.  

Do you really think some local judge gets to determine the outcome of the election and can hide rampant criminal activity?   All the judge did is set himself up to be investigated.  The only time I will worry is if the Supreme Court makes a crushing ruling against Trump which won't happen.   (Please read that again)

John Benedict Pedo Roberts is compromised, and he will be held to the fire.  Trump signed an EO in 2018 that stated election fraud would be treated as a threat to nat'l security with enormously stiff punishments.  As part of this, Trump is firing people at the CISA and DHS daily.   The enemy has been exposed.  

Amazing Polly said the DHS is loaded with Soros loyalists, and I don't doubt her, but it won't stop the outcome.   They will go to jail to if they interfere.  It gets better.   The Supreme Court ruled back in the 1800's that voter fraud vitiates everything, but more importantly, it precludes anyone from ever holding office in America again.   

So any liberal leader caught doing this will be immediately ineligible for office for LIFE and a stiff prison sentence.  The left is in FULL PANIC mode which makes me wonder why some of our fellow readers are as well, but the left's desperation is showing.   

Alien Zuckerberg told his employees at FakeBook Pedo Joe would be the next president.  If you do a Google search for Dominion, all you get is page after page saying Dominion didn't commit voter fraud.   I love it because when the liberal d'bags try to find real info on their own, all they will get is more lies and propaganda meaning the final outcome will be that much more devastating to them.   

Will they ever understand they were lied to?   Of course not.   They just want to hear someone tell them what they hope is true, not what actually happened.   Those who received my emails back in the days under the Fuhrer know these were gloomy reports since I presented the ugly dark truth about what the Kenyan one man sleeper cell was doing to this country, but nonetheless, it was the truth.  

The left is in the process of purging their own to cover their tracks.   Low level people are stepping down, being removed, etc.   Google is banning DOCUMENTS that detail the fraud.  The DHS guy who was just fired put out a memo from the DHS saying there is no evidence of voter fraud when we have nearly 1,000 sworn affidavits to the contrary making this guy a deep state traitor.  

The flash drives in Milwaukee were stolen election night.  The flash drives for programming the machines in Philly were stolen after the election, and were stolen and replaced in Sept before the election.  How bad is it?   Phone carriers are censoring texts and conversations about the fraud.  They somehow believe that if they keep the word from getting out, the election will be stolen as if the Trump team will just stop, all the facts will disappear, and Pedo Joe will get to molest dozens on camera at an inauguration that would be only attended by MAGA people there to boo him.  

FakeBook no longer is calling Trump president Trump even though he is officially the president for another 70 days.   Instead they are calling him a political candidate.   Twitter is blocking all searches for Eric Coomer, VP of Dominion who was at a ballot counting center in Detroit ‪until 3am‬ or longer.   Why in the hell was he there?!?   We all know why, and Twitter knows why hence the blocked searches.  

CM isn't done.   He tweeted that he just discovered a new nefarious plan to steal the election involving Google, and of course he is helping the Trump team.   The Trump team has publicly acknowledged the help they have received from CM.  

CNN just today devoted time to discussing how Parler is a "threat to democracy".  Seriously.  They view unfiltered free speech a threat to democracy.   These people are pure evil.  

Lin Wood noted that the GA governor gave $107 MILLION to Dominion and needed to be investigated for it.  He also said they have proof that China interfered both electronically and with hard copy ballots.   Lin Wood also asked on Twitter if people knew all our votes were being counted in Spain and Germany using Amazon servers.   

Is that why Bezos just sold $3 BILLION in stock?  

We have videos showing 50 BOXES of ballots arriving in Detroit ‪at 3:30 am‬.  NV pollsters tricked over 60,000 Trump voters into using provisional ballots to cast their votes which were then never counted.  Legal analysts noted that all the legal setbacks by the corrupt local judges in Philly will end up giving Trump discovery rights which will be even more damning for these evil bastards who cannot stop what is coming.  

Uber liberal online paper "The Guardian" is in full panic mode trying to hide and discredit everything they see taking place.  The Fuhrer is calling it un-american to question their treason.  (Lmbo)

I have been anti Ann Coulter for a while now, and this was the final straw.   She was GLAD Trump lost saying America wants Trumpism without Trump.   NO, you wench.  America literally LOVES Trump, loves Trumpism, and SHE doesn't want Trump because she is all cozy with liberals in her personal life having dated completely disgusting and vile Bill Maher.  She is dead to conservatives.  

Pompeo, Trump's Sec'y of State is going on tour to visit seven countries who welcomed their new Pedo Joe overlord, probably to let them know they will never receive another penny in US aid, nor any military protection.  The Trump team has geniously started calling this the immaculate deception.  

The anons keep noting that US military flights on US soil are at record levels.   They tracked 22 Apaches flying across the US this morning, the most they have ever seen.  It gets better.   Deep state traitor head of the deep state CIA, Haspel, has not been at any intel meetings since meeting with McConnell.  That brings us to this..   
A CIA member posted anonymously on 8kun.   8kun is where Q posts and where the anons are.   I have ZERO doubt he is who he claims he is.   He said that what we are seeing being discussed in the media is all a show.   The real battle is OVER, and what is happening behind the scenes right now is dems are being brought into conference rooms with the case being laid out against them giving them a chance to confess for a mere 5 years in prison instead of a decade, and people who thought they were untouchable have been seen coming out of these rooms in shock and tears.  (Awesome)

He said Trump is beyond pissed and wants to be named president ASAP.  He said he can post because his boss (Haspel) is "done".   He said to watch for Thanksgiving, Biden will be the turkey.   

I have seen TOO many posts just like this to know what is legit and what isn't.   I never trust a timeline because moves and countermoves make timelines fluid.  However, I firmly believe what he said what is happening IS.  Look at posts from Trump, Powell, Wood, Giuliani. CM, etc.  Q's last post was simply "Durham" and word is that Durham has stuff NO ONE has seen before.  If you are still nervous, then you are letting yourself be ruled by negative emotions.   Logic, reasoning and faith should have you absolutely giddy.  I CANNOT wait for the celebration!   

Anyway, I have read people who think that when it's all over with Mexifornia might go for Trump.   I don't think so, but the momentum is exclusively one way despite them putting up pitiful road blocks here and there.  We were TOLD this would happen, and it did.   Now we can burn the entire system to the ground and secure everything going forward along with a Trump victory.  It is literally the best case scenario.  

The X22 guy thinks they will use actual force to try to overthrow Trump.   Won't work.   The military is on his side, and he has MILLIONS flooding the streets in DC right now who would heed a call to arms.  The dems KNOW they not only lost, but are dead going forward.  

Uber liberal website Politico posted an article trying to explain that dems are not a "demonic cult".   LOL!   First of all, YOU ARE, but second of all, if you have to write an article trying to say you aren't, you are in TROUBLE!   

How about policy issues?  WINNING!  Trump announced Operation Warp Speed which means the fake pandemic is OVER.  This is his plan to show we have cures and vaccines so the "epidemic" is OVER.  He announced there other vaccines are in the final stages of testing and said America will NEVER undergo another lockdown.  This is the last hope for libs as lib state after lib state is getting more tyrannical.   Dim Whitmer canceled Thanksgiving and Christmas.   

De Blasio just said they would close NY schools until December.  They keep pushing the fact we have positive tests for CV-19 ignoring there are no deaths, and all these tests keep proving every day CV-19 is as fatal as a cold.  Pfizer said that unpleasant side effects from their vaccine "prove that it is working" which is perhaps the dumbest thing I have heard from someone trying to push science.  I guess if you die, it REALLY worked, right?  How desperate are these losers?  

Fascist Fauci just said Americans should "do what they're told".  Hello Dr. Stalin.   Let me show you to your cell in Gitmo.  

Interestingly, 130 secret service members are confined after testing CV-19 positive.   Seems like part of the RED count down listed by Q.  

Finally, did you know that the anti-ISIS envoy LIED to Trump about the threat to keep troops overseas.  These people are evil war mongers.

Hello boys! Remember me? I'm baaack!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The *ISS Endeavour* limped back into orbit around the Moon. The atmosphere inside the spacecraft was one of dejected misery. Colonel Holland, having left the ship on autopilot, sat slumped in his quarters, staring out aimlessly into the blackness of space. He blamed himself heavily for the loss of Gamma Base and the deaths of most of its inhabitants. Rescue crews from the *Unforgiving* and *Undying* had found a small group of survivors inside an emergency bunker. However, neither Colonel Foreman nor any member of the command crew had survived. 

“Coming into orbit now, sir,” reported Major Reece. Holland nodded absently.

“Sir,” Lieutenant Harris called, “Colonel Straker is hailing us. General Henderson will be arriving up here soon to debrief you and Major Reece.”

“Great,” the Colonel murmured. Getting up from his bunk, he strode to the door. 

“Signal Alpha,” he ordered through the radio, “Let them know we’re coming.”

Lieutenant Harris gave an affirmative as the pilot walked to the hangar. He was quickly joined by Reece and the pair boarded the *Endeavour*’s *Eurostar-IV* space shuttle. Walking up the boarding ramp, Holland slipped into the cockpit, Reece right on his heels. As the ramp slid upwards, the two pilots powered up the shuttle’s systems. 

After checking the spacecraft was ready to go, Holland signalled the *Endeavour* to depressurise the hangar. Once all the air had been sucked out, the hangar door underneath the shuttle slid open and Holland manoeuvred the craft towards the lunar surface, taking full advantage of the *Eurostar-IV’*s antigravity system to make a speedy descent.

Within minutes they had docked at Moonbase Alpha’s hangar. Swiftly changing out of their grey spacesuits, the two officers made a beeline for General Henderson’s office. As he walked through the door, Colonel Holland noticed that Colonel Straker and Major Black were also present, as well as a man he didn’t know.

“Colonel, Major,” Henderson greeted them as the two saluted, “I’m sorry about Gamma Base,” he said, noting the look of pain that flashed across both their faces, “I’ll expect your report on this later. Now, however, I want you to hear what the gentleman in the corner has to say,” 

He gestured to the shadowy figure in the corner.

“Director Howard, take it away,” the General instructed. Holland studied the director. He was a man of medium height, with an unassuming nature. He seemed to have been bred for spy craft; his face had no discernible features and he seemed like he could blend into a crowd of any nationality without anyone looking twice. 

The Colonel was sure he would forget the man’s face as soon as either one of them walked out the door. Even his hair was a nondescript brown-black mixture.

“Thank you, General,” Director John Howard spoke in a pleasant tone, “You have been called here gentlemen,” he nodded at the two Air Force astronauts, “To be briefed on your role in the upcoming invasion.”

“Invasion?” Holland looked quizzically at General Henderson. 

“You haven’t heard?” the General asked, confused.

“No sir,” Major Reece spoke up, “We’ve been flying shuttles for the past few weeks. No-one tells us anything.”

Henderson just grunted in response. Director Howard took up the conversation.

“Major Black here will be leading Task Force Bravo to capture a Consortium shipyard that we hope to repurpose,” the spy explained. Holland nodded in understanding.

“Now, during the invasion, we want you to send the *Endeavour* to these planets,” Howard activated a nearby T.V. screen with a laser pointer. The screen flickered to life, showing a map of the star systems surrounding Earth. Earth itself was highlighted in blue, while the target planet was shown in red. There were several other star systems highlighted in yellow. These captured Holland’s interest.

“The star systems in yellow will be your ‘targets’,” briefed Howard, “According to our good friend Ambassador Vymer, these planets are major centres for Consortium fleet operations. Thus, when the invasion begins, we want you and your crew to hit each base and cause as much chaos as you can at each one…”

“That way they’ll be distracted from the actual target?” the Colonel hazarded a guess. General Henderson nodded.

“From we’ve gathered, the Hegemony were absolutely terrified of the *Endeavour* when it appeared,” the officer added, “And the Consortium have seen the ship in combat.”

“And failed to kill it…” muttered Major Reece.

“We hope that its miraculous recovery will cause enough panic in the Consortium hierarchy long enough for us to put that shipyard to good use,” finished Colonel Straker.

“Can you do it?” asked Howard.

“Can dogs bark?” retorted Holland, “Sir, we’ll run rings around them.”

“Excellent,” beamed the N.S.A. director, “Hopefully you can…”

He was cut off by an alarm blaring. General Henderson reached for a phone on his desk.

“Report!” he bellowed into it.

“Sir!” someone on the other end called, “We have five enemy starships approaching!”

“Onscreen!” barked Colonel Straker.

The T.V. screen flickered and the image was replaced by sensor data from *Watchtower* station. The screen showed five Consortium vessels rapidly approaching a target. 

“Looks like three frigates and two destroyers,” noted Colonel Straker. Suddenly, he noticed something and his face went pale.

“What’s wrong, sir?” asked Reece.

“They’re targeting this base!” cried Straker. Henderson looked sharply at the screen. Reacting quickly, he smashed down on the intercom button.

“All personnel, this is General Henderson,” he spoke quickly, “I am calling Battle Stations! All personnel to defensive positions! Orbital defence and anti-air batteries to be engaged immediately! This is not a drill!”

“Major,” he turned to Black, switching off the intercom, “Get your men ready.”

Black nodded and ran out the door.

“Sir,” began Colonel Holland, “Should we…?”

“Yes,” Henderson cut him off, “Go,” he said shortly. The two pilots nodded and quickly followed Black out the door.

“*ISS Poseidon, ISS Unrelenting* and *ISS Undying* are on intercept course now sir,” Holland heard Straker report as the astronauts ran down the corridor to the hangar bay. Outside the base, hidden missile turrets and anti-air railguns slid out of their underground storage units and aimed themselves at the night sky.

“All astronauts to report to Flight Stations,” the intercom rang again. Holland and Reece passed by a group of spacesuit-clad starfighter pilots running to their assigned posts, “All airlocks to be sealed as soon as the last fighters are away.”

Rounding a corner, the pilots arrived in the hangar.

“All combat personnel, stand by to repel boarders,” the intercom rang ominously, “All window shutters and pressure doors to be sealed immediately.”

Holland and Reece raced aboard the shuttle. As soon as the cockpit’s hatch sealed, and without waiting for the ramp to retract, they took off. The g-force from the sudden ascent pressed them into their flight seats. 

As the *Eurostar-IV* rocketed towards the *Endeavour’*s position, Holland stared out the window. Maybe it was just the reflections of some of the hundreds of blinking buttons and display screens that lined the cockpit walls, but he swore he could see several bright specks approaching the Moonbase. Three more specks were also closing in, from the opposite direction.

There was a beeping noise, bringing the Colonel’s attention back to his instrument panel.

“Radar indicates we’ve got company, sir,” Reece noted as several shapes flew past the shuttle’s window. Examining them, Holland saw that they were the base’s ten F-41 fighters. The *Starfighter-II*’s formed up around the shuttle, before flying off to engage enemy targets. As the spacecraft faded into the distance, Holland and Reece brought the shuttle in to dock with the rapidly-closing *Endeavour*.

With expert skill and precision, the two astronauts docked. As soon as the small hangar was pressurised, they changed into their flight suits and moved into the bridge.

“What’s the situation?” Holland asked as he passed through the hatchway. Lieutenant Harris looked up from her console.

“*Poseidon, Unrelenting* and *Undying* have engaged the enemy sir,” she reported.

“Good,” replied the Colonel, sitting down at his station, “Fergusson, plot an intercept course.”

“Already done sir,” the navigator responded.

“Excellent work Captain,” Holland congratulated him, “Reece,” he said to the Major, “Let’s get out there.”

“Yes sir!” replied his co-pilot, pushing his throttle forwards. Holland activated his own controls, manoeuvring the starship towards the action.

“*Viper*\-squadron reports they have engaged the enemy,” Harris called, “*Undying* reports two of the enemy frigates are already disabled.”

Holland just pushed the throttle further, not wanting to miss out on the fun.

“Closing in on enemy positions, sir,” called Lieutenant Jenkins.

“ECM’s activated,” reported Lieutenant Freeman.

“Weapons free as soon as we are in range,” instructed Holland, glancing at his sensors.

“Roger,” replied the weapons officer.

After a few minutes, Jenkins activated his helmet’s targeting HUD. The HUD was linked to the warship’s targeting computer via Bluetooth, and gave the officer a direct feed from the craft’s targeting array. Not that it mattered, as the computer did all the work anyway, but it was still useful.

“In range now,” he reported, flicking several switches, “Weapons hot!”

The *ISS Endeavour*’s plethora of weapons opened up on the Consortium formation. 50-millimetre autocannons and 20-millimetre miniguns fired on Consortium starfighters, while the newly-upgraded railgun and anti-ship missile launcher shredded one of the remaining frigates.

“Good hit!” called Major Reece as he and Holland swung the ship around. The two enemy destroyers fired their energy weapons at the *Endeavour* as it passed. Holland felt the ship shudder slightly as the enemy fire impacted. The shuddering became more violent as another anti-ship missile was launched, penetrating the hull of  one of the destroyers and leaving a gaping wound.

F-41s from *Viper* squadron seized on the opportunity and fired missiles into the opening, causing more damage inside the mammoth spacecraft. A volley of railgun rounds from the *Poseidon* finished off the warship, blowing it into interstellar dust. 

One of the Orbital Defence station commanders had managed to get a lock on the enemy fleet and started firing his satellites’ weapons at the aliens. The combined fire from the U.N. warships, fighters, and satellites was enough to destroy the last of the raiders.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

As the warships headed back to their patrols and the fighters returned to Moonbase, no-one gave any thought to the cloud of debris left floating in orbit around the Moon. Slowly, one of the chunks of vaporised starship began turning, then moving towards the lunar surface. With uncanny ability, the ‘debris’ broke orbit, hurtling towards Moonbase Alpha. 

Inside the base’s command centre, a technician noted the debris piece as the blip appeared on his radar. He also saw it would impact outside of the base’s safety margin and paid it no mind.

The piece slowed itself down just before impact, gently touching down on the lunar surface. The highly-advanced spy-cameras and microphones inside the small probe aligned themselves with the Moonbase, specifically at General Henderson’s office.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Major Black took off his helmet, sighing in disappointment. He threw the multi-million dollar piece of headgear across the armoury in frustration, ignoring the death glare a technician sent him. For the past few weeks he had been suiting up in his Mk-III SPARTAN exoskeleton, only to be told he and his men wouldn’t be needed. It was annoying, and it didn’t help that the Major was as wound up as a spring due to the upcoming assault.

He almost wished someone would be stupid enough to land troops on the Moonbase. That way, at least, he would see some action.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

“I’m glad that’s over,” Straker said, relieved. The alarms had shut off a few seconds ago and the lights were returning to normal.

“Yes,” agreed General Henderson, “Imagine if that had happened while the President was here.”

“Speaking of,” Straker queried, “Isn’t he scheduled to arrive in a few days, before the invasion?”

“I think so,” replied Henderson, “I’ll have to check it with Roberts, of course.”

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Somewhere, in a star system hundreds of lightyears from Earth, a Consortium intelligence officer called out to his supervisor.

2020-11-15 07:00:34 : The cat in the road : that-other-one------ : https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/juhuk9/the_cat_in_the_road/

I’ve never had much luck creating scary stories from nothing, I guess it’s just not my style. So to tell you this story, is to admit to myself that I believe it is fully true. A story that I have been long too scared to tell. 

My dad didn’t think much when telling me this story, being a truck driver he had seen much more interesting things while driving on the road. But this one was different because we never easily accepted the supernatural. 

It was a night like any other, far away from the comforts of home, alone where your mind can play tricks on you. My dad was driving back home, being a truck driver he was used to driving long distances. Sometimes at night and alone.

He was driving on an older mountain road at night while trying to fight off exhaustion. Of course at this point, there’s a lot that can be explained by a trick of the mind. However, seeing a black cat in the middle of the road was only the beginning. His mind was slow as he tried to process the animal in the road.

Seeing roadkill was common, what wasn’t expected was the cat running in front of his car. He tried slowing down but it was too late, he felt in his body the bump as the car hit the poor animal. Coming to a stop, he got out of the car and went around to the front to move the cat out of the road.

The night air was cold and the darkness limited his field of vision. But he could see as clear as day that there had never been a cat. Hitting an animal would leave something. A carcass in the road, a messy tire, even the smallest blood splatter. But there was nothing.

Looking around he noticed the woods on either side of the road, dark and beckoning. Going quickly back into the car he tried clearing his mind before continuing on. It was such an unimportant moment that he tossed it aside and didn’t think much of it.

But then it happened again, the audible thump that he felt as he hit the cat. This time he didn’t stop. This time he continued driving and instead looked in the mirror back at the road. He didn’t see the cat now.

He wouldn’t bring up that moment for a while. The phantom cat still plagued him on dark roads while driving alone.
It was always a cat. Sometimes it would run out from the woods. But he always felt the bump, that thud he felt in his whole body that meant he had hit something. And he never saw the cat after hitting it, always finding nothing.

The next time it happened he finally decided to bring it up to his coworkers who had, in some cases, decades of driving experience. He expected them to joke about his sanity or not understand what he meant. He hadn’t expected them to take him seriously and tell their own experiences with the black cat. Although their stories were a bit different, rarely ever was it a cat for them. Instead they told their stories of a black dog. A dog that disappeared as quickly as it appeared. Some of them felt the dog helped them by walking them up.

But my dad felt that his interaction wasn’t meant to be friendly or helpful. There was something ominous and looming about the cat. Something very wrong, like a warning or a bad omen. These moments continued to happen from time to time, it was somewhat odd that it was a story shared by others. People who drove a lot, usually as there job.

So when I saw the black cat, and felt the woods call to me, I can’t help but give in to what it wants. The dark pines of the forest block the light of the moon. The howls sound human, but are surely a mountain lion. The forest is supposed to represent nature and freedom but this is so unnatural. My mind is clouding over and I can barely hear the crunch of moss and leaves underfoot. The far off hoot of an owl. Shadows pass over my dull blurred eyes.

It’s okay, nobody would give a second thought about a disappearance in the woods.

2020-11-15 07:02:27 : The Fanus were handled horribly in RWBY and they're fixable by adding less race based discrimination to their plot line : D_dizzy192 : https://www.reddit.com/r/CharacterRant/comments/juhvcw/the_fanus_were_handled_horribly_in_rwby_and/

Title. As a black dood I saw the Fanus' struggle as oddly sympathetic and it wasn't until I got older that I realized why, because they're the opressed minority and while extreme their actions are a response to oppression and not just them being terrorists for the lulz. Which is why the White Fang was written out of the story because writing something as complex as racism would have been "too hard" for the writers and also something something "Weiss was really really racist in Volume 1, right?"

Let's fix that though. Keeping as much of the core of the story intact as possible, change the Fanus to be just plain better than regular humans. They're generally faster and stronger, with their animal traits giving them bonus abilities like heighten agility, night vision, gills, etc. Make them strong but give them a lower birth rate, as in they can only mate with Fanus within their own subpecies, e.g. dog Fanus can't have kids with a bear Fanus, and even then there's still a low chance of actually conceiving (Which throws in a bit of lore to Fanus being polyamorus because the hav to think of the race and give a chance for character drama between Blake, Yang, and Sun).

So Fanus are strong but a minority and humans are weaker but plentiful so the oppression is more from humans encroaching on their land and Fanus being unwilling to fight back too much because every Fanus lost pushes them closer to extinction. Leading them to eventually integrate into human society but because humans are dicks and see anything as different as lesser, they push them around and exploit them for labor, especially businesses like the Schnee Dust Company, which inadvertently leads to regular humans losing their jobs too because why hire 10 humans to do a job 2 Fanus can handle. Things are steady for a while until a drunken argument leads to a brawl, leads to a death, leads to a riot, leads to a Fanus village being ransacked by humans and Grimm alike. This causes the creation of two groups, The White fang who are isolationists who want equality in a "Give us back our land, leave us alone and we remain neutral to each other so long as that remains the status quo" way, and after seeing/believing that peace wasn't gonna work and/or that violence would work faster, The Red Fang that just wanted to hurt humanity the way humanity hurt the Fanus but aren't the face of the organization. Think a covert splinter cell that exists within the WF and operates in a similar but more extreme fashion.

It's not as complex an idea, mainly because I'm not trying to make it so, but it works and leads to different character motivations that are and aren't just race based or the oppressed minority rising up to defeat their oppressors. Both groups hav reasons for being shitty to each other, with humanity still being the antagonist in most conflicts but it pulls things away from black and white morality to more grey and off white.

Minor elaborations: Characters like Cardin hate Fanus because his great grandparents lose their jobs to some so the parents taught the kids and so on.

Weiss hates them but the White Fang specifically because she's lived her in fear of them after multiple attacks on the SDC leading to her family's fractured state and resulting in her scar during one failed raid.

2020-11-15 07:04:12 : I need help, if anyone has a moment : Bubblegum_bubs : https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/juhw1c/i_need_help_if_anyone_has_a_moment/

I’m so confused and done with one of my closest friends. He’s hurt me and always takes out his issues on me and has in total, only apologized once for doing it. 

Multiple people have pointed out how he treats me and the moment I go to him and bring it up, he spins it like he’s done nothing wrong and it’s all me. He only does this when things are bad at home. I also just spend a good week at his house because I came down to see him for his birthday, then his dog gave me a concussion. Shit hurt and I couldn’t safely drive over a sea bridge back and did my best to still get him away from his hellish parents. So it’s not like I don’t put effort into trying to help him. Which isn’t to say that, that favor should be like ‘*You should be grateful*’ but more along the lines of ‘*I try really hard and in the end I end up your punching bag. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong, or even if I am.*”

I’m just, hurt and tired. I’ve even asked people who were around when the situation happened if I did anything wrong, and that if I did I wanted to understand what. They agreed they didn’t know and the way he was treating me was borderline abusive.  Honestly, that it was.

I don’t know what to do. I feed into his antagonistic pettiness, which I shouldn’t but I have my triggers. When I don’t feel heard, and especially the specific way he treats me (he literally server muted me so I couldn’t talk, knowing I had no way to unmute and defend myself. The only reason I talked over him in the first place ((his go to for when we argue which is a trait I’ve worked my butt off to pretty much smush)) was because I wanted to try and prevent a friend from being thrown into the middle of this, which she unfairly now is) I feel caged and like if I don’t fight I roll over and show my belly; as he claims I’m trying to force him to do.

I just want him to say sorry and mean it! I just want him to stop doing this. 

I feel so hurt and like everything’s my fault but know I’m just falling back into the same patterns that lead me down bad roads with friends. If I don’t stand up for myself it’ll never stop. I tried explaining myself over text, since he refuses to let me talk and with every point I make he says some petty comment and then my brain goes into fight or flight on voice chat. But it’s hard and it hurts when he won’t admit where he’s wrong. When he won’t realize he’s hurting me because he’s hurting, or that I spent a whole hour crying and just wanting to die over this. 

Because I always feel like I’m everything wrong, even when I know I’m not. Because I only live for the people who care about me, so if they don’t, where’s my reason?

I try and tell myself, I don’t need anyone’s approval and that I am all I need but, I’m not there yet on my journey. It probably pisses some of you guys off to read this. I just need help. There’s no one I know who understands me and how I think and feel. 

I’ve spent years fighting off the submissive personality I was groomed/beaten into having. But when I break down like this, it’s just so much easier to give in. I don’t want to give in, never again.

How do I fight these thoughts? How do I stand up for myself in a way that work? How do I handle his comments without being thrown into a post traumatic mindset with the need to fight out of the fear? How do I stop myself from responding in a defensive scared way?

Hey there! As the title says, I’m a 26-year old male hoping to finally find my Mrs. I’m a pretty open-minded individual, and receptive to learning and being exposed to new things and ideas. If there’s TV shows, culture, etc., that you’re aware of that I’m not, I really would love for you to share. I really would like someone that I can open up to, make silly mistakes with, and experience new things with. Cuddling on the couch, going for a random midnight drive or afternoon walk, and cooking/learning how to cook together are just some of the ways I’d love spending time with someone. The point is, I just would like to have someone around me that I can be close with and share experiences with again. Ideally, you would be someone closer to the DFW area so that we can meet in-person because that is the method of communication I prefer the most, but if you’re not, that doesn’t matter so long as we click.

A little about me:

· I’m about 5’6” – 5’7” and about 160 lbs, so if you’re looking for a big, tall, brusque guy, I’m definitely not what you’re looking for.

· Some of my hobbies include shooting (at least before current events made ammo nigh-unobtainable), reading historical books and sci-fi, video games (CoD, 

· I \*love\* animals. +1000 points if you have a cat. I currently do not own either a cat or dog because my current landlord does not permit it, but if he did, you bet your ass I would.

This is probably a long shot, but hopefully someone may have some idea to help me. For some reason after running Tron I am no longer able to play Watchdogs Legion. It just doesn't start up at all anymore. I have restored back to the restore point before Tron, I have uninstalled and re-installed the game, and so far it seems to be the only game that has stopped working for me. The only thing I can think of is maybe Tron changed some setting that is causing this, I literally have done nothing at all after running Tron that could possibly cause this...hope I can get some ideas here, thanks.

Hey there! As the title says, I’m a 26-year old male hoping to finally find some meaningful companionship. I’m a pretty open-minded individual, and receptive to learning and being exposed to new things and ideas. If there’s TV shows, culture, etc., that you’re aware of that I’m not, I really would love for you to share. I really would like someone that I can open up to, make silly mistakes with, and experience new things with. Cuddling on the couch, going for a random midnight drive or afternoon walk, and cooking/learning how to cook together are just some of the ways I’d love spending time with someone. The point is, I just would like to have someone around me that I can be close with and share experiences with again. Ideally, you would be someone closer to the DFW area so that we can meet in-person because that is the method of communication I prefer the most, but if you’re not, that doesn’t matter so long as we click.

A little about me:

· I’m about 5’6” – 5’7” and about 160 lbs, so if you’re looking for a big, tall, brusque guy, I’m definitely not what you’re looking for.

· Some of my hobbies include shooting (at least before current events made ammo nigh-unobtainable), reading historical books and sci-fi, video games (CoD, GTA, and a few others).

· I \*love\* animals. +1000 points if you have a cat. I currently do not own either a cat or dog because my current landlord does not permit it, but if he did, you bet your ass I would. Also, if you were to send pictures of your cat (dogs are cool too, but I’m really a cat person), I’d greatly appreciate it. :)

· My musical tastes are somewhat varied (sounds cliché, I know); I can go from listening to Dio one minute, to Joji, then to Hall &amp; Oates or Jefferson Airplane the next. I’m open to pretty much anything as long as it has a good melody and good vocals.

· I’m fairly certain I have ADD, so take from that what you will.

hey guys this is a long shot but I'm desperate. I'm looking for a kids computer game I played around 2004-5. I'm pretty sure it was supposed to be an educational game, my brother says he thinks it was for 4th grade learning. You basically just followed this orange alien from room to room and clicked on things in the rooms. It was set in space either in his space ship or his planet. You could decorate his bedroom with a telescope and stars all around the ceiling and in the other room he had a music area where you could play the instruments and a map that you could click on and play around with. I believe he also had an alien "dog." Also when you clicked on his he would tell jokes and laugh at his own jokes. I believe there was also a library you could go into. 

Anyways, that's all I really remember. It was a pretty uneventful game but it's bugging me so much I can't think of it!

2020-11-15 07:10:50 : My First Horror Narration Had Invited a Spirit! : MiskyTear : https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/juhyl7/my_first_horror_narration_had_invited_a_spirit/

I invited a friend over to join me in my narration. We were preparing the story for his little friend. The story we had used was from Mr. Sato, a university student from Japan. While we were setting things up, the light in the room flickered. We just ignored it since that kind of situation could have a lot of realistic explanations. However, the next experience was a tough one to even find an explanation for it. 

We were almost done with our narration when the dog outside howled. We took some rest for a while since the dog decided to keep on barking like crazy. I had some snacks which we could munch on while waiting for the silence to return that night. It took some time, but the dog went quiet again after a few minutes. Then, there was this continuous knock behind my apartment's main door.

I went to the living room to check who was that visitor. It was already 11 PM at that time and whoever that was, they were making me worried. The knock stopped when I told them that I was coming. I opened the door and found no one outside. It was strange, but I looked around just in case. Still no one.

I believe it was because of the story we were making at that time. It was the story of Minako and we were doing the sound effects by ourselves like the knock which was actually a spiritual game by itself. Our call and knocks must have invited that spirit.

The next day, I asked the owner of my apartment if there was anyone who died in their flat. They admittedly answered "yes" and the funeral ceremony took place in the room where I was currently at. Fortunately, the late husband of the owner was a good man. If her husband wasn't nice at all, I would have gotten out of the apartment right away! I do love horror stories, but I never wanted to see those transparent entities. Imagine having that special third eye or sixth sense since childhood. It must be difficult for a young child to grow up while seeing the ghosts around them. They can either grow up not caring about the world and the life itself, or grow up like Courage the Cowardly Dog. Ain't he cute? Seriously, even if a person is scared of ghosts, they would still protect their families and friends. That's what we call courageous!

Hi! This is MiskyTear and it was my first time to have an English horror narration on YouTube. It was fun! Wait, should I really have to say that it was fun? Actually, it was scary.

If you're interested to know what's the story we were narrating and about that spiritual game, feel free to visit "MiskyTear" on YouTube. I'm a new Horror Narrator and I'm looking for true horror stories to narrate. If you find my voice to your liking, I'd be happy to narrate your stories. 

Thank you so much and until next time! ^^

I need help finding an episode of a murder show that aired when I was a kid, probably sometime between 2001-2009. I remember there being a bad divorce and a custody battle for the dog, a German Shepard I think. To settle it, they put the man and woman on opposite sides of the room and had them call for the dog. It went to the woman and she won. Later, they found it strung up in the bathtub in her apartment, bled into the tub. Turns out she rubbed bacon on her hands so the dog would go to her instead of the man who was the original owner. 

Was this fictional or real???? A fever dream of child me or something that other people remember?? Please help!

Let my dog sniff for a moment, then I opened the gate.  My dog bolted forward and this white Samoyed he ran past went after him.  He jumped on him and started barring his teeth and tried to attack him. My dog was caught off guard so he didn’t fight back and remained surprisingly calm, he stopped running when he got to a corner and the dog got off his back.  It seemed the fight was over until the owner came and grabbed her dog, then My dog who was pretty calm, suddenly tried to attack him.  He was in good spirits after the dog left.  This is the first time he was attacked like this however, nearly all his fights have been with intact males.  So far he’s never started it and usually avoids even sniffing intact males now a days.  98% of dogs he sees on walks or parks, he’s very confident and friendly.  However sometimes he goes up to the dog, then backs down and slowly turns away without barely sniffing them.  When the dog approaches him, to sniff, he avoids it  by walking away and will even tuck his tail if they try to sniff this bum.  Now if they try to jump on him after all those signs, he’ll probably snap at them.  

It seems he feels challenged and threatened by other intact males . It’s good that he avoids confrontation but in cases like today where he got attacked by a dog he wasn’t even paying attention to, it seems I have to fix him ASAP.  I was gonna anyway cause of his marking but now I have another reason.  

Will fixing reduce the issue?  He’s 11 months.

2020-11-15 07:13:20 : [REQUEST] [BATTLENET] Call of Duty Black Ops Cold War : zultari : https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/juhzhi/request_battlenet_call_of_duty_black_ops_cold_war/

Hi, I'm requesting if someone could buy me Cold War on [Battle.Net](https://Battle.Net) so I could play with some friends.

I'm strapped for cash right now due to a vet bill and my car dealership I bought my car from has screwed me over, so money is tight right now for me.

My dog is a rescue from a family member. He's a small corgi mix and is overweight, lost an eye to another dog a couple years ago, and has gum disease (just learned that one, but could tell from his teeth after being told.) He's really sweet and loves attention so he has been a perfect fit. Unfortunately the vet I went to did not ask for permission for things when he went (family member took him cause I went to work, told them the dog only needed booster shots) and charged me an extra $100..

My car I got recently and has had a bunch of issues. Wiper motor went out day 2 of having it, but I was able to get it repaired, only took a week from the mechanic though.. Then I went to get new tags and I learn the dealership never took care of the license plates being transferred over (which this is my first "new" car, I put trust into them to figure that out I guess, naive..) So I had to pay more money for the tags and to fix what should have been done. 2 months previous, my car's brakes were completely rusted out. (Honestly I am not a car person at all.. I'm paying the price on this car heavily and regret it so much..)

So there's my issues with why I'm low on cash. My friends have bought Cold War and I watch them play over Discord's streaming. I feel like I am missing out, since this will be all a couple of them will play for months.

My [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) is Zultari#11132 . I appreciate it if gifted. If not, no harm. Thanks.

2020-11-15 07:13:12 : DLE (Lupus) suggestions for my dog : corndiggitydoggo : https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/juhzfq/dle_lupus_suggestions_for_my_dog/

Hi my dog is a 3 year old female Australian shepherd weighing about 42 lbs. We have seen 2 primary vets that believe my dog has discoid lupus. She has been experiencing symptoms on her nose for about 2 months now and I have reached out to multiple dermatologists to begin testing and diagnosing. Upon trying to schedule a consultation with multiple dermatologists, I have not been able to get an appointment for at least a month from now. 

My concern right now is the spread of her skin lesions/ sores. The initial area on her nose is remaining affected and is spreading slowly around her snout, but my main concern is that she is now forming new sores around her eyes. 

I know that on this thread you can’t offer much treatment and we are awaiting official diagnoses, but I am wanting to see if there is anything I can do to help slow the spread of this disease until we can see a dermatologist. I reached out to our primary vet again but they are not able to get back to me until after the weekend. 

Since my dog is very young and active I exercise her very early in the morning around 8 am before the UV index is high, keep her indoors throughout the day, and take her out again once the sun goes down. The vet initially prescribed her a topical ointment called entederm and I apply it to her nose twice a day. I am very concerned about the location of the new sores that are forming around her eyes and would appreciate any suggestions to help her until we can get to a consultation. Anything will help! 

I will try to post photos of her ASAP!

Doing research, I’ve seen a lot of people say their dogs get SAD (seasonal affective disorder) or basically the winter blues some of us humans get when the time changes and the days seem shorter.

[Part One](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/jf97kk/humanitys_vengeance_the_fall_of_praxis_iii/)

(As requested, here's part two! Hope you all enjoy it! Any feedback is welcome!)

Xarrix tried to tell himself not to be afraid.

It was an easy thing to say, but a much harder thing to do. The landing craft pitched beneath his chitinous feet as it screamed toward planetfall through a sky thick with flak and anti-voidcraft fire. Its deck shook violently as it veered to avoid being incinerated, and more than a few of the troopers around him lost their footing, stumbled and fell. 

Xarrix did not have teeth, but if he did, he would have gritted them with the effort it took to keep his fear-glands under control. His twin antennae palps twitched. He looked down at his weapon and checked its readiness for what must have been the millionth time. It was not a weapon made by his people. No laborer or hive metallurgist of his people had brought it forth from the foundries of their homeworld. The weapon had been made by humans, for humans, on a planet populated by humans many hundreds of light-years away from the battle raging outside. 

The landing craft had no windows. It had been deliberately designed that way, for it would hardly help a soldier’s morale if he were able to look outside and see other troopships being blasted out of the sky. But even without windows Xarrix knew. The noise alone was so loud that those with external auditory organs tried to cover them. He was grateful he did not have any. The small pinprick holes on either side of his cranium could be easily covered with a specialized membrane beneath is carapace.

He felt his hearts began to race as the dropship continued its rapid descent, tightening his hold on the rail overhead to keep from tripping. Xarrix was no warrior. None of his people were, not by nature, not like other species.

Not like the humans.

The insectoid Kaleekians, the race to which he belonged, were builders. Not fighters. They had made their world of Andrax into one great, globe-spanning hive, carving vast networks of tunnels and building massive mound-like nest cities both above and beneath the ground. For the wealth of Andrax lay in its soil, in vast deposits of ores and metals so rich that the output of just one mine could equal that of an entire star system. With such a bounty beneath their feet, what else could the Kaleekians have become but a race of metalsmiths, craftsmen and architects? Indeed, it came so naturally to them that most Kaleekians had never contemplated being anything else. Even their religion, music and poetry revolved around the shaping of stone and metal. Their music employed the same hammers and other tools they used in their cavernous forges, and their gods were the Builders, immortal architects who placed every star in the sky and forged every planet upon their celestial anvil. The Kaleekians believed that every blast of steam from the great smithies was the Builders’ breath, and every forge and workshop was a church to their glory.

And so the Kaleekians had prospered for millenia. Their hives grew larger, their forges grander. They sold the things they made to surrounding systems, and brought great wealth to their people from trade. Kaleekian goods became known across multiple sectors for their beauty and quality, and as their technological prowess grew, so too did the variety of the things they made. Starship parts, electronics, consumer goods, it didn’t matter to Xarrix’s folk. They were happy to accept contracts from just about anyone, as long as the terms were fair, and they could hone their craft in peace. And for thousands of years, they had done just that.

But this golden age had also sown the seeds of their downfall. Xarrix knew that now. All his people did, though they hadn’t known it at the time. 

The only thing the Kaleekians had refused to make were weapons. They were creators, not destroyers, and the idea of using their great halls to churn out tools of death and destruction appalled them. There were other places that made weapons in great quantities, other forge worlds. Those who needed or wanted weapons could go there, but not to Andrax. No weapon ever came from its foundries or smelters, not for offworlders and not for the Kaleekians themselves. And why would they? What need did the chosen of the Builders have for weapons? If they were attacked, they could simply go underground and seal themselves away, for in those vast underground caves they had everything they needed to be self-sufficient. But why would anyone want to attack them? The Kaleekians were not warriors, they did not make enemies the way other races did. They dealt fairly with everyone who approached them. There was no reason for them to fight anyone, nor for anyone to fight with them.

It made Xarrix shudder now, to think that his people had ever been so naïve. 

That naivete had died the day Praxian ships had entered Andrax’s upper atmosphere and subjected their innocent planet to a storm of orbital weapons fire. Their world had cried out and shuddered in pain, and some of the great caverns had collapsed, killing millions of Kaleekians in an instant. The great mound-cities on the surface had burned to ash along with their race’s innocence, and when the invading armies had landed, the Kaleekians had nothing to defend themselves with. 

The Praxians wanted the Kaleekians’ skill and the resources of Andrax for their empire, and they had seized both with ruthless efficiency. They subjugated the Kaleekians and turned them from a proud race of craftsmen and forgeworkers to just one more race of slaves, bound in chains and forced to work beneath the whips and cruel eyes of their new overlords. The great forges were corrupted into factories that produced millions of weapons for the Praxians’ war machine. The hive cities were turned into slave pens. Even the images of the Builders were torn down and replaced with idols of cruel Praxian war gods. All the Kaleekians had achieved was reduced to ruin, or worse, turned to evil purpose. The Kaleekians’ lives were made bitter by their conquerors, and for generations, Xarrix’s ancestors had lived and died in chains.

And then the humans had come. 

They had come as a thunderstorm comes—with little warning, little notice, and overwhelming fury. Xarrix had been topside on an errand for one of the overseers when he’d seen the flames of war in the sky. He’d looked on in awe as, one by one, the Praxian ships that held his world in thrall were destroyed. The noise was incredible, and more and more slaves had stopped what they were doing, turning their gaze heavenward even as their masters’ electro-whips fell across their backs. 

The Praxians were being annihilated. How and why, Xarrix had not known, but whatever came next could not possibly be worse than what the Kaleekians had already endured. He and the other slaves and swarmed the overseer, and within a day riots and revolts had erupted across Andrax. The Kaleekians had rallied to the aid of their liberators and taken terrible, bloody revenge. Not a single Praxian was left on Andrax alive.

And then the humans had come, bearing a message of liberation and news of the wider galaxy. Beyond Andrax the void was aflame, they had said. They too, had suffered at the hands of the Praxians, and now they were bringing a war of righteous vengeance to the empire of the oppressors. They had not asked for Kaleekian aid at the time, but they did not have to. The humans had set them free, given them hope for the first time in living memory. Nothing, not even all the vast resources of Andrax, would ever be enough to repay that debt. To the last hatchling, every surviving member of the Kaleekian race had sworn undying loyalty to the humans and their Terran Confederacy. Kaleekian youths, like Xarrix, volunteered in droves to serve in human armies, and the great forges were put to work once more. 

But now the Kaleekians had no problem making weapons. The Praxians had taught them well.

Now, as he hurtled toward the surface of Praxis III, Xarrix clutched his own weapon tight and tried to muster his courage as best he could. Whatever the humans asked, he would do. His oath, and what the humans had done for his world, demanded no less. For dozens of other species conquered by the Praxians, the same was true. The humans had cast off the shackles of each world they took from the enemy’s grip, and more than a dozen races now fought in its armies and fleets.

“Planetfall in thirty seconds!” the pilot yelled over the din. “Get ready, you lot!”

*Builders,* Xarrix thought, closing his mult-faceted eyes. *Please watch over me.* 

The ship rocked even more violently than before, and the pilot cried out in alarm and veered to avoid a direct hit. “Almost there!” roared the Terran officer who’d been placed in command of Xarrix’s unit. *Gon-za-lez,* Xarris thought. *His name is Gon-za-lez.* 

“Remember, our orders,” Gonzalez continued. “The orbital shield generator in this sector has be to taken out to clear the way for fire support from the fleet.” He pointed in the distance, drawing their eyes to a massive bunker complex behind the Praxian lines. “That’s it there. We push through these bastards, we kill them, and then we take it out. Our bombers can’t do it—whatever that building is made of, it’s proof against most of our heavy ordnance. So it's up to us. We’re going to break the door down and clear it out the old-fashioned way, then destroy it from within.” His face set in a grim line. “If we succeed, our ships will be able provide us with orbital fire support and make our jobs a whole lot easier. but if we fail, it’ll be a much longer slog to the Praxian capital and hundreds of thousands good soldiers will die before we get there. Is that clear?”

“Sir, yes, sir!” the troopers replied.

“I SAID, IS THAT CLEAR!?” Gonzalez roared.

They snapped to attention, including Xarrix. “SIR, YES SIR!” 

The transport ship lurched to a screeching halt. The grinding whir of its landing gears being deployed was drowned out by the noise of war raging outside. Gonzalez shoved his way to the front, flicking the safety off his pulse rifle as the ship’s doors slid open. 

The surface of Praxis III was a firestorm of battle. Laser fire of every color stitched the air in all directions, while overhead hundreds of starfighters dueled in vicious dogfights. Every few seconds a burning craft belonging to one side or the other would plummet to its doom in a column of smoke and flames, while the ground was already littered with the dead and the burning wrecks of hovertanks, mobile artillery pieces and heavy guns. There was no cover on the dry and arid surface, no place to hide. The only way for Xarrix and his comrades was forward, and in that direction, several hundred yards distant, lay the Praxian lines. The hell being unleashed by the enemy was terrifying in its ferocity, and despite being under heavy strafing and bombing from the Terrans, the rate of fire didn’t seem to be slackening at all.

Even as Xarrix watched, a heavy gunship bearing the eagle symbol of the Confederacy laid waste to a section of Praxian fortifications with a payload of cluster bombs. A solid line of scorching flames blossomed in the ship’s wake. Hundreds of Praxians were reduced to cinders in an instant, and those unlucky enough not to be killed instantly ran in all directions, shrieking and ablaze, before they finally collapsed. 

The sheer diversity of the Terran troops startling, too. There were four-armed hulking Gorgorians fighting and dying on this battlefield, many of which carried heavy assault cannons and multi-barreled auto-guns in each massive hand. Reptilian Scathori, resplendent in their brightly-colored battle-dress, chanted hymns of slaughter as they poured from their troopships and into the fray. Xarrix knew the Scathori well, for they had been friends of his people before the Praxians came. A devoutly spiritual race, they were led into battle by their warrior priests who had eschewed Terran weapons in favor of battle-staves crafted in the jungles of their homeworld. These long rods served as badges of office in peacetime, but in times of war they could be fitted with a miniaturized disintegration weapon that unleashed white-hot beams of energy. Lupine Canorians, those great wolf-like bipeds, howled over the din, almost falling over themselves in their eagerness to close with the enemy. Blue-feathered Solari, six-legged Jorians, and—Xarrix’s heart soared—other Kaleekians like himself. 

Sergeant Gonzalez turned to face them. There was no time for a grand speech, nor was one necessary. Instead, he opened his mouth and roared out the battle-cry that had heralded doom for dozens of Praxian worlds—and liberation to those they had subjugated.

*“*FOR TERRA!” he roared.

*“FOR TERRA!”* Xarrix cried, adding his voice to the roaring refrain. He had never been to Terra, would likely never see it, but he would fight for it, for Terra and Andrax stood as brothers now. 

They poured from the landing craft, roaring and cheering, and all around the maelstrom of death continued unabated. 

The Terrans charged over the open ground, heedless of how many of their dead they left behind, and the Praxians—spoiled for choice of targets—began to take a horrific toll. Xarrix saw an entire brigade of Scathori get blown to pieces by a heavy shell, saw the explosion of blood and viscera and severed limbs that flew in all directions. His every instinct screamed at him to run, but he could not. He *would* not.

He had to keep going.

He had to honor his oath.

They were running now, running full-tilt at the enemy through the blistering, deadly hail that sought to scythe them down. Many died before they knew what hit them. Others fell, maimed and torn, and screamed their last on the dusty, bloodstained earth. 

They were getting closer. The enemy lines were nearer now. 

*Keep going. We have to keep going.*

A Gorgorian two steps ahead of Xarrix was hit with a las-round. His head disintegrated, and Xarrix couldn’t help shrieking as he felt himself get sprayed with blood and bits of brain and bone. He spared a brief prayer to the Builders for the dead one’s spirit, but they could not stop to mourn him. If they stopped, they all would die. Even Xarrix, new to the ways of war, saw that clearly.

Closer now. Closer.

Hovertanks began to open fire as they came within range and began pounding the Praxian positions. The roar of their turret guns left a ringing in Xarrix’s auditory organs, but the sound was as sweet to him as music. Even sweeter was the sight of Praxian bunkers and pillboxes being blasted to smithereens.

Closer. Ever closer.

Gonzalez opened up with his pulse rifle, and his entire unit followed suit. Xarrix was not a natural fighter, but the Terrans had trained him well and his movements were smooth and practiced. He brought his weapon up to his left eye, aimed, and fired.

A hundred yards away, a Praxian died.

Xarrix didn’t stop to think about that. He chose another target, aimed, fired, then chose another. And all the while he kept pace with Gonzalez and the others, pounding the earth with his insectoid feet as they closed with the enemy.

He could see the Praxians began to panic, saw the fear on their faces when they realized they were going to be overrun. The sight was very pleasing to him. Now the Praxians knew how his people felt when Andrax fell. Now they knew what it was like to be invaded and besieged and afraid.

As the humans were fond of saying, payback was a bitch.

Several Praxians tried to flee as the Terrans closed the distance, only to be shot in the back by those of higher rank. A second later, the Terrans smashed into their lines.

And then all hell *really* broke loose.

Gonzalez leapt into one of the trenches, firing at everything that moved and cutting down a dozen Praxian soldiers before they could even bring their own weapons to bear. The Scathori *leapt* through the air at their hated enemies with savage frenzy, some of them even casting their arms aside and ripping the Praxians apart with their razor-sharp claws and teeth. Even his fellow Kaleekians were caught up in the frenzy of close combat; they poured over the Praxians like a horde of crazed army ants, stabbing and shooting and using their rifles as clubs when their ammunition finally ran out. 

Xarrix saw a Praxian soldier, gave a chittering screech, and ran at him. His bayonet plunged into the other alien’s chest like a hot knife through a slab of butter. The Praxian stared, looked up at Xarrix, and gave a dying gurgle.

“For my people,” Xarrix whispered. 

He tore his weapon free in time to see another Praxian charging at him. This one must have been an officer, for his uniform was more elaborate than the one Xarrix had just killed, and he wielded a sword whose edges glowed with intense heat.

Xarrix shot him in the chest. The officer fell, dead before he hit the ground, and Xarrix wrenched the weapon from his twitching hands. He put it to good use a second later by cleaving a Praxian’s in two.

“Keep moving! Gonzalez roared. “The shield generator can’t be too far!”

“How will we know it when we see it?” Another human, a female, yelled back.

“It’ll be the largest and most heavily-defended spot on this entire front line, of course!” Gonzalez laughed with bleak humor. “Come on!” he added, addressing his comrades. “Do you want to live forever? Forward! *Drive them back!”*

The Terrans pushed, and kept pushing, and the trenches became a tightly-packed slaughterhouse. Praxian and Terran alike fought with everything that came to hand: rifles, pistols, blades and bare appendages. Xarrix saw the woman who’d spoken a moment earlier torn apart by las-fire at point-blank range, and even Gonzalez himself narrowly avoided death by seizing a wounded enemy soldier and using him as a shield. When the woman’s killer had emptied his ammunition clip, he tossed the corpse to one side and shot the Praxian as he frantically tried to reload.

Blood washed the trenches in rivers as the Terrans carved a path to their objective, but the Praxians were stubborn. They knew what was at stake and each step toward the blockhouse that housed the shield generator was paid for in blood. Xarrix fought with all his might, spurred on and encouraged by the bravery his comrades. All around him people were blasting and shooting, screaming and stabbing, falling and dying. The ground became so thick with corpses that he had to step high in order to walk over them. Xarrix was careful to avoid the honored dead of his own side, but the Praxians he trod upon without a second thought. One of those Praxians was still alive, though from the gaping hole in his belly, he probably wished otherwise. Xarrix ended his misery by stabbing him in the throat.

The shield generator was almost within reach now. Fifty yards, maybe seventy-five at most—

Without warning, a withering fire erupted from within the complex. Whether it came from automated defense systems or from living soldiers Xarrix didn’t know, but it ripped through the advancing Terrans without mercy. Dozens of humans and their alien allies fell in an instant, cut down like wheat before the reaper’s scythe. In the packed confines of the trench network, the carnage was beyond all hope of description. Xarrix himself only managed to avoid being shredded by throwing himself to one side at the very last instant and taking cover behind a mound of corpses. Many of his comrades were not so lucky. Those who were hastily took up defensive positions and scrambled for what little cover they could find.

“Someone take those guns out!” Gonzalez roared. “We have to get closer!”

“I-I’ll do it!”

Xarrix was as surprised as anyone else to hear himself speak. The Terran tongue did not come naturally to his people—their mouths were not made for it--but the translating device he wore at his throat translated the clicks and hisses of his native language as he spoke. “I’ll go, Sergeant.”

“Don’t be an idiot! You can’t go out there alone! You won’t get ten yards before you’re—”

“But I won’t be going toward it,” Xarrix said hastily, fighting not to let his fear and anxiety show. “I will be going *under* it.” He lifted his head a little, speaking with pride. “My people were burrowing deep into the mantle of blessed Andrex for thousands of years before the Praxians came. The Builders, our gods, blessed us with bodies well-suited to digging even without machines to aid us. Let me and some others of my kind go, my lord. The shield generator may have a hard shell, but its belly may be soft.”

“Why didn’t you think of this before?!” Gonzalez demanded. “Why didn’t *any* of you think of this before? You could have made that suggestion to me, I could have taken it up the chain of command--”

“We are not warriors,” Xarrix said defensively. “Not like you. We are new to the wiles and strategy of war. Please, lord, do not bear this against my people. I….I only wish to help!”

Gonzalez nodded once. “It’s a hell of a lot better than any of my ideas. Do it, then!"

Xarrix nodded. “Thank you, lord.”

The human snorted. “I’m no lord. But if you pull this off, you might as well be one. Good luck, kid.”

“And…” Xarrix swallowed. “If I fail? Will I bring disgrace?”

Gonzalez put a hand on his thin shoulder. “No,” he said. “If you fail, you will have done your duty to the best of your ability, and you will have shown initiative and courage. If you die, your honor will be intact.” He slammed a fresh power clip into his rifle. "We’ll distract them and draw their fire to buy you some time! Now go!”

Xarrix let out a shuddering breath. “Thank you, lord.” Then he turned to the nearest group of Kaleekians huddled nearby. “Brothers! Sisters! Come over here and listen to me, I have an idea!”

I’m so fucking sick of it. Latest girl: someone I’ve known since I was in high school when she was in middle school. Met her at my friends graduation party. Had a crush on her for 20+ years. She got married. Marriage ended badly. Somehow we ended up talking on Facebook. She came up to my house. I fucked her brains out. Talked to her on the phone a couple times. Schedule a second meeting. Everything seemed cool. Second date time comes around and she’s nowhere to be found. Call her and text her and no response. Eventually get in contact with her and she’s like she wants to date. So I schedule a second time. Same shit. Everything‘s good until she supposed to meet me, except she doesn’t show up. After this she becomes nonresponsive.

I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I have a 9 inch dick. I make over 100 grand a year. I have a beautiful house. I have an awesome dog. I got a great ride. I’m funny. I’m intelligent. She said she’s into bondage. I’m a master of bondage.

I went out and bought a bunch of stuff for her. Perfume, ropes, ball gag, dick mounted clit vibrator, etc.

But she won’t respond to my text messages. I’m ready to give up. I’ve put myself out there. What else can I do? I don’t think there is very much more I can do.

I knew something wasn't right when you weren't sitting still yesterday evening and kept moving from one spot on the floor to the next. I tried to give you treats but you didn't want any. When you walked you had your head and tail down. I took you to the animal hospital and after waiting and waiting in the car the doctor came out and said you had taken a turn for the worst. You had a mass and your stomach was twisting. You were just fine a day ago...

It hurts even more because you still acted like a puppy even in your older age. Loved to chase the laser pointer around and play fetch outside, but were unable to recently because you got injured earlier in the week doing what you loved and were slowly recovering(I'm hesitant to delete the reminders I have in my phone to give you your pills). In the last day or so you finally started to feel well enough to stare and whine at the place where I keep the balls I throw around for you, but I didn't want to rush you back so soon because you still had a slight limp. One of your other favorite things to do was sit/lay in the backyard and watch for chipmunks climbing in the trees and bushes. I'm sure you would've stayed out there all day if I let you. 

When the doctor brought you into the room earlier and you saw me, I saw you wag your tail for just a few moments even though you were probably in pain and were coughing up foamy stuff. I'm going to miss the loud barking when we come home and seeing you first thing in the morning when I get up lying in your doggy bed that we made you. I'm going to miss running around with you outside and playing fetch every night. I'll always remember you as that cute "discount" German Shepherd/Border Collie mix puppy I got at a flea market in South Carolina.

2020-11-15 09:57:20 : Husky with high prey drive and cats : thisishumerus : https://www.reddit.com/r/siberianhusky/comments/jujly7/husky_with_high_prey_drive_and_cats/

Hey everyone, 

So my partner has a (previously outdoor) 7 year old husky who needs to become an indoor dog. He has a very high prey drive and has killed other, small animals before. He needs to come inside as our neighbors have caught him stealing chickens, but I have two cats. 

Our plan for right now is to keep both cats in the basement, completely separate from the dog, but I'm wondering if there's a better long-term solution as I really am anxious about the cats running out if one of us (or one of his kids) is going into or out of the basement. 

The dog is generally very obedient when we're around, and generally the prey drive is out of boredom. He shows friendly interest in the cats in their carriers (when coming into and out of the car) but obviously I want my cats to be safe. 

I thought we could try introducing them with the dog on a leash, and attempt to show him they're part of the household, and I know it's unlikely they can ever be left alone together, but I was just wondering if there was any way we could get them to peacefully coexist when we're supervising. 

Thanks!

2020-11-15 09:57:51 : My girlfriend broke up with me over me having a heartattack. : lookingForPatchie : https://www.reddit.com/r/vegancirclejerk/comments/jujm4e/my_girlfriend_broke_up_with_me_over_me_having_a/

So my girlfriend(27f) and me(38m) have been together for 15years. Our relationship had its ups and downs. We had huge struggles in our 4th year, when I accidentally killed her dog by giving him chocolate, but that happens I guess. Then her mom died, because I gave her milk instead of soy milk and she was lactose intolerant, but that happens I guess. But she doesn't yet know I killed her. I wanted to tell her at some point, but it never really came up. On the plus side we bonded really well over it so that's good.

Now the real struggle was when she decided to go vegan. Now you see the problem with veganism is, that it totally disregards the slaughterhouse workers. They need to make a living to, you know? Live and let live. Now don't get me wrong, I enjoy a piece of meat, as animals are our servants that are happy to be eaten, as god has said. But even more I care about packaging plant employees, that struggle to feed their families. So everytime we went out to eat I'd eat an additional meat dish, so they don't struggle. I felt like including this, as it shows her lack of compassion, which should've been a red flag for me since the beginning.

Now for totally unrelated reasons I had a heart attack a week ago and my gf broke up with me over it. Now I'm feeling miserable, heartbroken, but I'm not sure if it is because I miss my gf or because I recently had a heart attack.

Also I'm not sure if I should keep on eating additional meat dishes, as she is no longer in a relationship with me, I feel like I am no longer oblidged to make up for her lack of compassion. 

Please, I am struggling. I need advice.

2020-11-15 10:30:02 : I think it's time.... [Vent] [Discussion] : The_loony_lout : https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/jujxbm/i_think_its_time_vent_discussion/

This post is hard to write but I need to do my due diligence before I finalize my decision. My dog is an 18 year old Staffordshire Terrier. He's amazing, he is always playful and gentle with everyone that meets him, I've had multiple roommates get a Staffordshire Terrier after living with me. I'm torn up though, he's going down hill and I'm refusing to admit it. I'm in denial and I'm getting dragged down by him; I feel guilty about this too.

Today, he's almost 100 percent blind and deaf. I don't understand why it seems to fluctuate were sometimes he can hear, albeit not great, and he can recognize things in front of him. Either way, he's struggling. He's in a lot of pain, he knows where I keep the pain meds and every morning he stands by them until I give them to him, I've tested that he indeed was seeking the meds and he has waited for over half an hour until I give them to him. It's so difficult though cause he is still mobile, he hops through the yard and when I bring him in from outside. He walks but he's always anxiety pacing pretty much all day and all night. When I turn the light off and shut the door, he starts heavy breathing every night while walking circles in my room and knocking everything over. Tonight he damaged the window blinds by knocking my music stand into them. He gets trapped in closets with the door open cause he can't figure out how to get out and he stops and stares blankly at open doors for 5 to 10 minutes sometimes. Unfortunately, I think it's time as he no longer has a desire to go to the bathroom outside. He poops in the house 3 times a day, messes 5-6 washable diapers a day and I'm getting exhausted caring for him. I'm attempting to spend more time with him before I let him go, I'm attempting to take him for walks but he no longer will work with a leash, he digs his paws in and refuses to move when I leash him. His hips are starting to go in the back, he falls over quite a bit and to turn around he flops on his butt and uses his from legs to spin himself. I could probably get him to go outside more but the time commitment is insane now, sometimes it takes him 2 hours before he will poop outside and even at that time frame, a lot of times he will poop the moment he gets back inside.

I'm heart broken, I've had him for 18 years, he's been by my side every step of the way. I'm lonely and isolated and he's been the only consistent thing in my life. Through my high school years, my time in the military, my battle with depression and injury. I almost severed my lower spinal cord in the military. I tore out the cartilage above an below a disc that left me in crippling agonizing pain and caused cervical myelopathy and kyphosis for the better part of a decade and triggered a pain induced schizophrenic episode. The horrible thing is, I was aware of everything going on and kept attempting to communicate the problems to multiple medical teams, my family and friends to only have them turn their back on them. My girlfriend at the time cheated on me as well nd left me during this time period too. I kept repeating myself saying "I'm in pain, I'm having hallucinations, I'm unable to sleep, I keep losing feeling in the left side of my body and my legs quit working randomly causing me to drop to the ground" while pointing to the exact spots that hurt, I honestly don't even know how else I could've communicated this to them and they still kept telling me I was having mental health episodes. Some have apologized after all the MRIs that they did; I lost use of my legs during a simple physical examination and then people started listening to me instead of assuming I was crazy. I lost so many friends and family members as a result. I'm struggling every day and spend most of my time on bed rest now with braces and pain medication. I'm able to walk again though and I'm grateful for that. I'm getting long winded, this is still hard for me to talk about, but the point is, even when my friends and family abandoned me, my dog was there. He would nuzzle me and sleep with me during my crippling muscle spasms and every time I went to the ER he would be waiting for me at home. He would always be ready to play with me even though I could only really use my upper body to move and any prolonged walking or use of my legs caused crippling back pain and made me feel like I was having a stroke. He's been the only reason I had to get out of bed when I was hurting. He's amazing, I wish I could remember happier times of him more clearly but the truth, I think it's time to let him rest.

I want to do my due diligence before this though. He's still mobile and runs when he's not on a leash, although being blind, he does run into things and this tough for me to watch. He's in a lot of pain, he's deaf and blind, he has cancer, he poops in the house a lot and he seems to be in a perpetual state of anxiety; I want him to pass naturally though. I'm struggling to take care of him with how much he requires and my physical issues too. I'm projecting myself onto him though, I'm broken and just because I'm not at 100 percent capacity, I wouldn't want someone to put me down. I'm accepting the idea more though as he will only get worse and this isn't just an "injury" that needs to heal. I'm struggling making the decision to take another living things life though, especially an animal I care deeply about.

I'm hoping there would be alternative for him to be comfortable until he passes naturally, are there associations out there that will take elder dogs and care for them? 

What could help prepare me for euthanizing him? I'm scared of losing the one constant in my life...

2020-11-15 10:33:46 : Age gap relationship m30 f18. : Pragster : https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/jujyoa/age_gap_relationship_m30_f18/

I need some thoughts. We started dating about 5 months ago. We immediately hit it off really well. We started hanging out more and we started catching feelings. Everything is good. But there’s one thing. This is an age gap relationship. She is 18 and I am 30. I know.. This is not something I had ever done before, or planned. And things look bad from the get go. 
 But we were just on the same frequency. She is mentally mature. We loved each other. I tried to be careful in the beginning. I made it an easy choice for her to leave a couple times, just to see if she actually wanted to stay or not. She held on every time. 

She told me she loved me at one point. I did not tell her back, because I was afraid she only told me in the spur of the moment. But then she told me again some weeks later. Then I told her I loved her back. She also told me she felt so safe and comfortable with me, she could be herself. Same with me. Man we had so much fun being goofy. She told me I made her feel she only needed me, no one else. We talked to each other with sentences like «when we are married...» We laughed a lot. It was special. It was good for both of us. She also told me she thinks we are so alike (mind). And I agree. We thought about the same things all the time. We reacted the same way to things. I mean, we were best friends who also loved each other. 

Issues:

1.
I knew her mother didn’t know about us. And her mother has a big role in her life. They are really close. I know she thought about how her mother would react to the relationship. She was scared. 

2.
We took a trip to London together. When we were on our way back I got a message from my sister. She could pick me up from the airport. She was watching my dog, and I needed to meet her to get him back. I told my girl she could also catch the ride with me, but if she were not comfortable meeting my sister then no problem. My girl said she wanted to catch the ride with my sister. 
But days after this trip my girl was more quiet than usual. I knew something was off. She told me she got scared and she felt bad for meeting my sister, when she hasn’t even told her mother about us. I think this might have been a turning point.

And then. One friday we were out to eat. One month or so after the trip to London. Her mother tells her in a text to go do something. I notice there’s a little more stress to it than usual. So we eat and we split so she could go do that thing. The day after she is worried and sad. She tells me we need a break. I was with friends when I got the message, and I was a bit drunk. I panicked and said things that didn’t exactly make her less stressed.  One thing I told her: I wanted her to just be honest with her mother and tell her about us. But I think that only stressed her out even more.

So she decides to break it off with me. She tells me she is not mentally able to keep a relationship and at the same time deal with problems in her family. I had some relationships over the years. But I know what we had was something else. We were like twins. We had an unusual connection. And everything she said to me made me confident she saw the relationship the same way I did. 

I know that this is a relationship which probably most of you will see as a bad thing or a stupid thing to do bacause of age. I don’t think I am a stupid man. I knew what I was doing, and I tried to be careful. I tried not to push her at all. I tried to see her as a young woman who didn’t know what she was doing, just in case that was true. But she convinced me she was conscious about her choices. When she convinced me I let go. I didn’t hold back anymore. No more doubt. It was great. And then she broke it off.

I am sad and a bit confused. I blame myself for letting her into my heart. «How could I ever think this was going to be it.» But most of all I miss her. I only want her back. I feel she was a part of me for real. And if everything she said and expressed was real, then I know I was a part of her too.

I was thinking to leave her alone for a month, then ask how she’s doing. What do you think?

2020-11-15 10:35:34 : Kennen actually feels useful now, and I fucking love it. : B_Duchsherer : https://www.reddit.com/r/Kennenmains/comments/jujzaf/kennen_actually_feels_useful_now_and_i_fucking/

&gt;Note: This is my second time writing this, because the first time I was doing it on my phone and the Reddit App crashed for me halfway through and I lost everything I wrote. I was almost done too :^ )

I'm gonna be going through what I've found to be the most effective and fun builds on Kennen so far in PreSeason. Note that this guide will very likely get outdated very quickly.


**Primary Runes:**

Here's the primary runes I go every game.

&gt;**Fleet Footwork** - Very nice rune for extra sustain and movement speed. I like the extra movement speed because Protobelt is complete dogshit now (more on that later).

&gt;**Triumph** - All around great rune that can come in clutch in teamfights.

&gt;**Legend: Alacrity/Tenacity/Bloodline** - These are honestly all interchangeable depending on the situation. Alacrity is good for an easier time CSing in the early game, but I personally don't like it that much. Tenacity is generally what I go most of the time. It can help you survive in teamfights. I like this the most because hard CC can make or break a play for Kennen, so the less time you're CCd the more you can engage and help your team. I go Bloodline if the enemy team doesn't have much hard CC at all, and you're basically guaranteed to be able to do a good engage.

&gt;**Coup De Grace** - Good rune for surprise damage and can clutch out fights in lane.

&gt;**Cut Down** - Good rune if you're going up against a team with 2 or more takes that you're going to have a hard time dealing with otherwise.


**Secondary Runes:**

Secondaries are a lot more fun, as well as a lot more flexible.


**Sorcery:**

&gt;**Nullifying Orb** - Good against heavy AP comps.

&gt;**Nimbus Cloak** - ZOOOOOOOOOM!

&gt;**Transcendence** - Good early game against takes you need to poke down a lot, and even late game to help dish out more damage in teamfights if needed.

&gt;**Celerity** - ZOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!

&gt;**Absolute Focus** - Good if you're the primary engager and want to surprise the enemy with high burst.

&gt;**Gathering Storm** - I always go this rune if I'm taking Sorcery. It's just free AP, which synergies well with Kennen's core item (more on that later).


**Domination:**

&gt;**Cheap Shot** - Free damage after you stun. I recommend going this against tank heavy comps because of the true damage. 

&gt;**Taste of Blood** - Good sustain in lane and survive ability in teamfights. If you take this I recommend also taking Ravenous Hunter.

&gt;**Eyeball Collection** - Good snowbally rune if you know you'll get a early kills. I recommend this when you go Cheap Shot.

&gt;**Ravenous Hunter** - Like Taste of Blood, but now with extra blood!

&gt;**Ultimate Hunter** - Basically all of your playmaking potential is in your ult, so having it up more often allows you to make big plays more often.

**Items:**

And now for the fun part, and the reason Kennen feels so good to play now.


**Core:**

&gt;**Night Harvester** - HOT *DAMN* this item is fucking busted. This item just synergies so well with Kennen. 80 AP, 250 Health, and 15 Ability Haste. It's passive, The Reaping, Is honestly fucking OP. "Damaging a champion deals an additional (x) magic damage and grants you 25% Movement Speed for 1.5 seconds... ...Damaging a new champion will extend the duration of the Movement Speed bonus." Let's break this shit down. The item damages any enemy hit equal to your AP, and it doesn't have a fucking cooldown. So if you have 100 AP and you ult into 5 people, you just dealt an additional 100 magic damage to every enemy on the team. And then you have a bonus 25% movement speed for 1.5 seconds that stacks with every enemy hit. If you ult all 5 enemies that's 7.5 fucking seconds of 25% bonus movement speed. This item is just insane and honestly feels like it was made just for Kennen. With Fleet Footwork, Nimbus Cloak, and this item, if you flash ult into a teamfight nobody will be able to run away from you, allowing you to get a guaranteed stun off on everyone. This is one of the reasons why Protobelt is fucking garbage right now. This just offers Kennen so much more, and it deals more damage. This item let's every single item Kennen buys after it be a powerspike. I build this item first every single time without fail. It's just way too good to pass up.

&gt;**Horizon Focus** - 100 flat AP with a passive that allows you to deal 10% bonus damage for six seconds after hitting an enemy champion. I always go this item second right after Night Harvester. This item is great because it greatly increases Night Harvester's damage while at the same time synergies extremely well with your ultimate. 

&gt;**Rabadon's Deathcap** - Deathcap. I remember when they first invented Deathcap. Sweet, sweet Deathcap. I ALWAYS HATED IT. #JusticeForZonyahsRing. In all seriousness, this is *the* mage item. 120 flat AP that boosts Night Harvester's damage even more. What's there not to love? I like going Deathcap 3th if I'm ahead. If I'm even or behind, however, I'll take it 4th. Right after...

&gt;**Zonyah's Hourglass** - This item is really good on Kennen, since most of the time you'll be the main target, as you're in the middle of all the chaos that you've started. Decent AP, decent armour, and decent ability haste with an OP Active.


**Situational:**

&gt;**Void Staff** - Magic Penetration is OP. If the enemy team is very tank heavy, build this after Zonyah's, and before Deathcap. Otherwise, just build this whenever you feel like it. 

&gt;**Morellonomicon** - A must have against champions like Fiora, Maokai, Kayn. Yuumi, Soraka, ect. Basically anyone with healing. If You're laning against someone like Fiora Sett or Mordekaiser, or are getting camped by Kayn or Ekko, I recommend rushing an Oblivion Orb, and then finishing it after you get Night Harvester and Horizon Focus.

&gt;**Cosmic Drive** - This item, in my opinion, isn't much needed on Kennen if you go Night Harvester. You already have insane movement speed from NH. The AP can and Ability Haste can be nice, but if you do go this item I'd do it in situations where you'd build Morellonomicon just for the extra damage instead of the Grevious Wounds it applies.

&gt;**Mejai's Soulstealer** - If you picked up a Dark Seal early and have 10 stacks, this can be an insane snowballing item. Very situational, but fun if you're able to stack it. Try getting a Stopwatch or Zonyah's Hourglass right before or right after to try and help save your stacks.

&gt;**Banchee's Veil** - Good against heavy AP comps that have hard CC.

Welp, that's basically the basics. I hope that you try this and if you do I hope that you have fun trying it as well. If you have any feedback or recommendations, let me know because this is my first time writing something like this. GLHF!

2020-11-15 10:39:53 : [THEORY] The entrance of the soon to be unvaulted VoG might be under our nose : MysticRathalos : https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyLore/comments/juk0no/theory_the_entrance_of_the_soon_to_be_unvaulted/

Hello everyone

I spent 30 minutes to write my theory because I'm not a native english speaker and I want to be sure everyone understands what I say, but when I went to kiss my dog I closed the app by accident so I lost everything :(

Anyway one picture says more than 1000 words so...

I think THIS is [the entrance for the D2 Vault of Glass](https://imgshare.io/image/img-20201115-105050-01.N0oqsH)

Of course it might be on Nessus, on a tiny Venus zone unvaulted for the occasion or on a complete separate zone like the Leviathan raids, but I want to believe

For the people who don't know, this portal was built by Clovis Bray during his quest for immortality and when he went beyond it, he witnessed a HUGE blue 13-billion years old star that serves as a forge for the Vex who keep it alive since almost the birth of our universe

I didn't read the second part of his logbook yet, but in the first part he also mentions a dark tower that doesn't seem to be Vex and that is surrounded by some sort of fog (can't remember the exact words)
I read the beginning of the second part though, and he also mentions that he sent his first darkness-radiolarian mix filled Exos through the portal to scout the forge, and maybe the tower, which might be that one tower mentioned in the D1 Grimoire about the DSC and the dream all the exos did, but anyway

Why wouldn't the D2 VoG take place on Nessus or a tiny Venus ? I don't know, but as much as I want Venus to comeback, I want it to come back with a real lore reason and most importantly in its entirety and I don't think Bungie would unvault a complete destination mid-year whereas the Cosmodrome is not complete yet

I want the VoG to come back with a good lore reason as well and I don't think a copypasta of the D1 version would be a good one, whereas a Vex forge that is almost as old as time itself and has a huge link with the current story surrounding Clovis, Eramis and the Exos' origin...THAT would be cool as hell, and I don't even think about the dark tower and the potential skyboxes yet

The VoG may be returning as an activity (almost same steps and mechanics), but it doesn't have to return as the exact same zone and with the same bosses and purposes

Anyway thanks for reading, I hope it was understandable and I hope you guys will share your theories as well, have a nice day :)

Edit : Eramis not Vigris (french name)

2020-11-15 10:40:08 : Help needed buying a solid work/studying laptop : WebSlinger96 : https://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/juk0qv/help_needed_buying_a_solid_workstudying_laptop/

My partner’s looking to buy a laptop she can use for work, watching lectures and for an upcoming doctorate course so it’ll be quite heavily used at times. We’ve seen a good deal for an Acer Swift 3 with the latest AMD Ryzen 5, 8gb RAM and a 1tb SSD which seems a great deal, it even comes in purple which is a bit of a bonus. However we’ve read reviews of them being somewhat dim (between 212 and 230 nits) and there’s a bit of concern about this. Is this something to be worried about?

If you have recommendations for others, we’d like something with a decent amount of RAM, a good amount of storage (at least 512gb SSD) and something that will last a while with some heavy use. Budget probably up to £800 GBP

Here’s the link to what we’ve seen:

2020-11-15 10:42:02 : I really like elohkar as a charchter and think people are way to mean to him. This is just a bit of a rant about that. : IWantToJustTalk : https://www.reddit.com/r/Stormlight_Archive/comments/juk1e4/i_really_like_elohkar_as_a_charchter_and_think/

 

TL;DR: Elohkar might have been a pretty good king if dalinar hadn't worked constantly to undermine his position and instead had worked with elohkar. As readers, our views on him are based on the POV characters who are often biased against elhokar for multiple reasons including dalinars treatment of him through the books. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I am reading oathbringer at the moment. And i feel really sorry for Elohkar. He got done dirty. Ive seen a lot of people say he was a weak king or had bad leadership skills but i think that’s unfair. I don’t think he has bad leadership skills just that no one respects him. There is a difference. If you piss your pants no matter how good your leadership skills are no one is going to respect you. elhokar was like this however no matter how hard he tried he was constantly undermined. Taking it back to the beginning of when he had got the crown he was immediately placed in a horribly disadvantageous position. His father had earned the respect of the other high princes through literally conquering half of them and beating the rest into submission. Gavilar had their respect through warfare and had the blackthorn at his side if anyone decided to disagree. While Gavilan was a great leader to be sure he had secured the respect of the high princes through war. These same high princes were far from devote subjects to the crown and were always looking for excuses to show autonomy. Gavailars reign as such was defined by the constant threat of his and Dalinars military might. Elhokar did not have this respect and it was unlikely that he had been sent off to war like Adolin at a young age where he could at earn the respect of the generals. Let them get to know him. He was most likely brought up in the capital away from the war around maids and ardents. BTW this isn't his fault nor is it nesscarily bad. Elhokar stayed where his father was in the capital. Dalinar had no need to go out fighting campaigns so his son had no need to go out and do the same. So when Gavalir had died and he was thrust into the spotlight he was surrounded by people who already were ready to leave at a moments notice. The vengeance pact was probably one of the best things he could have done. Uniting the high princes in a common goal most likely saved the kingdom from falling apart. Now unlike Gavaliar Elohkar was missing the blackthorn. When Gavilar died so did his most powerful weapon in forcing the other high princes to work obey the thrones. Dalinar seemed to forget his importance and his sudden shift in personality undermined the throne. Elohkar was a dog with no bite. However, I do concede elohkar was not the greatest king. He could have played some amazing political manoeuvre to show how great he was. Maybe not as a warrior but at least a politician. But he didn’t. This doesn’t make him stupid though. Through oathbringer we constantly see him attempt to be a better king however the damage that Dalinar had done was irredeemable.Its not that he was stupid or a bad king but the impression in everyone’s mind was already there. When he comes up with a good plan every one acts surprised. When he comes up with a suggestion or a plan people look to consult dalinar as to whether it’s ok. Throughout all of Way of king Dalinar worked to undermine his nephew’s authority. And when Elohkar asked if he was a bad king or not :

*“You think I’m a poor king, don’t you, Uncle?”*

*“What? Of course not!”*

*…..*

*Dalinar laid a hand on his nephew’s shoulder. “I’d be a poor brother if I didn’t wish that Gavilar had lived. I failed him - it was the greatest, most terrible failure of my life.” Elhokar turned to him, and Dalinar held his gaze, raising a finger. “But just because I loved your father does not mean that I think you are a failure. Nor does it mean I do not love you in your own right. Alethkar itself could have collapsed upon Gavilar’s death, but you organized and executed our counterattack. You are a fine king.”*

*- The Way of Kings, chapter 18*

Here dalinar acknowledges that elohkar isn't bad but instead of speaking honestly and telling elohkar the truth on how he can improve and trying to teach elhokar how to lead he brushes it aside place elhokar as basically a figurehead. So when people go and treat him like a figurehead we can’t be all that surprised. It’s not that he was bad at his job. Or that he didn’t have good leadership skills. He was just never allowed to do his job. Dalinar had taken it by the time we meet them in the books. It’s not that Elohkar was wrong or his idea was stupid but that people are so used to viewing him that way all his actions are seen through the lens of a fool. I think the quote by hoid highlights the problem.

*"Elhokar though, he worries about the wrong things. His father wore a simple crown because he needed no reminder of his authority. Elhokar wears a simple crown because he worries that something more lavish might make people look at it, instead of at him. He doesn’t want the competition.”*

*-Hoid 68 Aim for the Sun*

While this quote is meant to show how elhokar is fundamentally bad at his job I think it shows the problem with everyone else. The problem is less with what elohkar does but how people perceive what he does. This quote  Elhkar could do the most perfect thing, act in the best way and yet people would still treat him as the flawed character. As the character who just doesn’t understand what he is meant to do. When elhokar fails it is a result of an irredeemable flaw in his character that makes him unifit to rule. But when someone like khaladin or shallan fail, which they do significantly more then ehlokar, it is simpy part of there character development and growth of their characters. Elohkar was probably more mentally stable and mature then just about any other character in the series. We can see he was actually trying to go through actual growth as a person and become a better king. But the problem is similar to the one I have with renarian. We just dont get any of their perspectives. We don't know what his thinking, we don't really know how much he is changing as a person. All we see of him is what other characters see of him. Which is already a pretty heavily skewed perception. Our perception of him comes from POV characters which often are biased against him. Khaldin because of elhokars relationship with Roshone. Dalinar compared to his father constantly and overpowers him in every meeting have. Shallans view point is then influenced by how everyone else treats him. When she arrives Elohkar is almost at the lowest amount of power he has in the series.  

This isn’t helped by the fact that he is placed on such a high pedestal. Not only because he is king but because of all the people, he must compare himself to. His uncle and father conquered the kingdom. His sister and mother are world-class scholars. Then eventually there comes a lowly dark-eyed bridge boy who turns out to be radiant. Even the lowliest peasant is better than the king. When Elohkar is compared to these people it gives a distorted view of how good he actually is. Sanderson does this purposefully. You couldn’t find me a single good quote about Elhokar before his death. Every compliment he gets is backhanded. Every interaction he has there is a comment about how he is unfit or out of place as king. Or just generally annoying. Bloody hell when kaladin had stupidly challenged Amaram to a duel preventing Sadeas from being cornered. They blame Elohkar for not reacting properly and corning Sadeas. If you dont understand how unfair this was, I'll explain. Although what kaladin did was impressive and should be commended as badass when he made that challenge he had undermined Elohkar. If he ignores Kaladin then people see him as weak, and the throne was already almost baseless. Elohkar couldn’t let it go and had to punish him to prevent the throne from looking even weaker than it already was at this point although he didn't have to lock up khaladin if he didn't he would have looked weak. Then as he is trying to punish Kaladin Dalinar basically shows that the throne has almost no authority by bullying Elhokar into letting Khalid go and retain his station. Not only that Adolin went and served the sentence with Kaladin further presenting Elohkars decision as stupid. Now the a dark eyes who disrespected the king and ruined the plan went almost unpunished and is able to walk free with no long term reprocuccusions. And at the end of that apparently, Elhokar is the one at fault. Not the guy who caused the commission in the first place. 

This is then compounded with the fact that he was surrounded by Cryptics making him ( quite fairly) think that he was going crazy. So we and the character in the show just thought he was paranoid and a shit leader. 

Overall Elhokar was a pretty good leader. I'm not saying he was perfect. He clearly wasn’t going to become a bondsmith or anything. But he was a good person and he did try very hard even before he went to talk to kaladin. The reason he seemed so bad was mostly Dalniars fault by treating him like a kid and undermining all of his decisions. I think the reason he comes off as so bad is due to how Sanderson wanted to portray him. I always though it was to contrast how much he grew but looking back the hole Sanderson dug for Elohkar was basically unassailable. He was viewed as an idiot with no authority as king. But whats worse Sanderson did this on purpose because that was elhokars fate. There was nothing he could have done.

Chciałem kupić konsolę zamiast PC by mieć poręczny sprzęt do grania na lata.
Chcę grać po taniości a z tym trudno na konsolach, ale do rzeczy.

Ominęła mnie poprzednia generacja. Chcąc ograć gry z poprzedniej generacji na nowych konsolach znacznie łatwiej znaleźć używki na OLX dla ps4 bo było bardziej popularne w naszym kraju. Na PS5 ni musisz płacić za grę online w gry typu warzone czy Apex, kolejny argument za PS5 nad Xboxem. 

Dodam, że gamepass mnie nie interesuje bo są tam same starocie, jedynie do ogrania nowinek jak Medium czy Starfield.

Z drugiej strony nie interesują mnie exy sony. Te wszystkie unchartedy, soulsy, tsushimy, spidermany, dayz gone, etc to dla mnie plastikowe, LGBT+ drewno robione na jesnym silniku, totalnie nie dla mnie(może z wyjątkiem last of us 2 bo ma dość fajny gameplay)

Bez wahania wybrałbym PC by cieszyć się 144hz w grach multiplayer, ale nie ma takiej możliwości, a chcę dość tanio ogrywać nowości (tak do 200pln). PS5 chyba będzie lepszym wyborem bo więcej ludzi ją będzie posiadać a to = szybszy spadek cen gier jak assassyn czy watchdogs na tą konsolę miesiąc po premierze? No właśnie, ale bardzo chcę mieć konsolę na święta a nie wiem czy dostanę ps5:/

2020-11-15 10:45:06 : The demon creature that may have returned and the banging noises at 2 am. : acabwh0re : https://www.reddit.com/r/spoopycjades/comments/juk2hd/the_demon_creature_that_may_have_returned_and_the/

im putting this as paranormal but honestly it could be a psychopath or creature.
About two nights ago i heard a banging noise at 2 am. This wasn't the first time i've heard it but I was fully awake this time. It got loud quickly. My sister living right below me texted me freaking out. IMPORTANT Our bedroom are right on top of each others and the backyard deck is right outside my window and underneath the deck is right against her wall. It sounded like there was a  hospital bed banging against the wall is the best way i could explain it. It shock the whole house. We both were freaked the fuck out after it didn't stop for 10 minutes. We woke up her boyfriend who immediately thought it was my dog trying to eat the deer he had recently hunted that was underneath the deck. He ran outside and sure enough my dog was there trying to eat the deer. But my sister and I werent convinced our medium sized flake of i dog could make that much noise but we went to sleep regardless. Tonight, around 20 minutes ago i heard it again, the deer is gone, my dogs inside.

This might be a reach but I think it's a creature that's been torturing my sister and I. 
In January my dad and stepmom where gone in mexico and it was just my sister and I home alone for 3 weeks. I took my dog out to have his last pee before i went to bed and he went to go outside but he stopped and ran behind me and hide behind my legs. My dog is a little shit if there was a cougar or any west coast big animals around he would've tried to fist fight it. I already had the creeps but i peaked my head around my gate and i saw a larger cat looking animal that had white patchy fur and red eyes with spit dripping from its mouth stared at me. I freaked the fuck out ran inside. When i told my sister she explained that she saw the same exact animal under the deck earlier that day but just thought she was hallucinating and didn't want to tell me to scare me. We didn't see it since then but maybe it's came back. But how would it? since January my backyard has been gated up and closed in. 
I hope you enjoyed my story i have plenty more i wish share. I will give any updates if we find the truth about the banging noises coming from under my deck.

2020-11-15 10:45:22 : How often do Danes clean their homes? : efbitw : https://www.reddit.com/r/Denmark/comments/juk2l0/how_often_do_danes_clean_their_homes/

OK, weird question, I know. We’re from Eastern Europe and we live in the suburban KBH. The strange thing that we realised is that while we clean the house every week (airing out carpets, pillows etc., and hoovering / cleaning the floor, toilets - you get it) we have not seen any other neighbour do the same in a year! 

So I beg to ask, how often do Danes clean and to what extent? I’m aware that everyone wears slippers, so do we - plus we have a dog, so that also warrants the diligent clean up.

Secondly, do the Danes pay for weekly/monthly cleaning service, or do they do it themselves (given how expensive everything is)?

I did not intend to offend anyone, genuinely interested.

Mange tak!

2020-11-15 10:46:37 : Unexpected veteran's day rescue. : thearticulategrunt : https://www.reddit.com/r/thearticulategrunt/comments/juk2zs/unexpected_veterans_day_rescue/

Sorry this is not well planned, I should have pictures and will include some later but as usual I'm writing while at work.  I'll try to remember to add pics over the next couple days.

So as many here know my daughter is smart as hell and has a good heart.  She has also really matured and done well with the mostly at home schooling in response to covid.  Being able to go at her own pace rather than being stuck in a classroom at the pace of the slowest classmate has really been good for her and her grades have skyrocketed.  I mention this because it was part of the list of reasons my wife used to try and get me to do what she jokes about as a "puppy stroll".  (Yes also chance to brag.)  We never get anything/anyone but my wife likes on occasion to take a day and go visit the local humane society and rescue shelters.  It is usually just several hours of going and looking at the various dogs as I get a worse and worse headache that can last a day or more from all the enclosed barking spaces.  I finally "gave in" on veterans day.  (She also said if we found a German Shephard I could name it Dogmeat.  I love Fallout 4.)

So about 2 hours in and we hit the humane shelter.  My head is throbbing but we are walking the kennels.  No one is grabbing my attention or my wife's for that matter.  It is just becoming a chore.  Then as we walk through a row of mostly red flagged "staff only/no fingers" kennels someone whines instead of barks or growls.  I step back and look down to find I am being stared at by an Anatolian Shephard mix.  Not a puppy or young dog paperwork says she is 6 1/2.  I kneel down and just kinda off the cuff ask her 'what is it".  She whined again and ever so gently, like a out of a bloody Disney movie puts one paw on the chain link.  ?WTF?  

The papers on her kennel are incomplete so I grab a staff to find out why and they believe she is on hold and unavailable.  About that time though one of the senior staff comes and collects her and takes her into the back.  My wife is really interested and I just had a WTF moment so I follow and ask about her to the lady at the service desk.  Apparently she was dropped off.  She is chipped but the information no longer works.  It does not even give them a name anymore.  Apparently she was on hold in case of an attempted retrieval as she was a drop off but had just come off hold.  Not that apparently anyone had expressed any interest in her apparently.  They brought her back out from getting a shot (she has "happy tail") and took her back to the kennel so, as I knew my wife wanted to, I asked if we could take her for a walk.  Of course they were happy to let us and let us know she even seems to have some training.  Okay cool.

We go to take her into one of their grassy walk spaces and she does okay on the leash.  All is fine until I take a knee to fiddle with my shoe.  She immediately relocates to sit behind me in a posture I can only describe as watching my back.  I get up and go to the bench.  Sitting down I raise my right are and give 2 quick slaps to my right side ribs.  She is instantly on the bench, turned and in a perfect sit under my arm.  "Some training" my arse.  Someone has invested a lot of time and money in her training.  My wife and I run a few more tests and I'd almost say she is/was some type of service dog.  Okay time to check legalities and fees.  Sorry, we've always moved on in the past but something with her just struck a cord.

So cherry on the cake, as I am checking fees and everything the lady behind the counter mentions that if I happen to be a veteran and have proof of service that they are running a veterans day special where all adult dog adoptions are free and all merchandise purchases are half off.  So we walk out with Curie for $6 for a new collar and leash.  

But that's not where our story ends.  Oh no.

A lot of dogs have issues with cars, especially drops offs/abandons.  My wife and I are discussing this walking to the car and I hit the remote unlock.  Curie moves to the side of the car and posts (sits at full attention, eyes on the door).  I open the van door and tell her to "mount up".  She is instantly in the car, takes a back seat and sits in the seat perfectly.  Driving home she leans with every turn like a veteran rider.

What could be a long story shortened we get home and with a half hour, with no barking, no growling just strong posturing and holding her ground she has established that she is in charge with our other 3 knuckleheaded doggos.  Now our cat Squirrel has taken off hiding around the house and is still being pissy even today but Curie did not chase her or anything.  The cat just freaked out.  

So we move to introducing her to the yard.  Walk the fence line together, see there are no holes, everything is good, show her her borders and go ahead and let her off the leash.  She relooped the 1.5 acres in heartbeats and came back to us.  Annoyingly from half way across the yard I see one of the stray cats from trailer park come over my fence and start prancing across my yard.  My other dogs have gotten used to these interlopers and will sometimes give chase but more often than not don't bother.  Bugs the hell out of me because they stalk my song birds.  I look down and just out of hand ask "well are you going to get it?" and the fur missile launches.  I shit you not she took off like a missile from my hip flat out sprinting.  Had the cat not had half the yard she would have got him.  As it was he got up one of the small trees just avoiding a leaping snap on Curie's part to try and catch him.  Now she did not recall perfectly but that may just be us not knowing her commands.  As soon as my wife walked up and clipped a leash on her though she was back on my wife's hip and walking away just fine.

Back inside, she is suddenly completely chill.  My wife sits down on the couch to chill and Curie sits on the floor in front of her looking at my wife.  As soon as my wife said "okay come on" Curie was up and laying down with her.  Thing is, Curie is displaying none of those annoying spacial dog issues.  No constant rolling or twisting, no pushing or spreading out.  Curie very gently finds a spot laying on or with and makes herself comfortable.  Curie has also not once fussed at our daughter, even when she fell asleep half laying on Curie.  Curie just laid there and went to sleep with her.  It's almost like Curie has been with us for years and it has only been days.  She will even come and nudge my hand now when she needs to go out.

Add to this she has a "soft mouth".  Not once has she tried to steal food or get into a plate and when given something, she has yet to nip or anything.  She just ever so slow, gentle and softly takes whatever is being offered.  That is one thing though, if you are eating, she comes and stands by sitting at perfect attention.  No excited tail wagging or anything just sitting perfectly like she is waiting for her share.  Hilariously, she is already causing Mojo, our Rottie, to mimic the behavior.  Used to be he had to be kicked out of the kitchen or he would get under foot and be a pain.  Now, he has taken to sitting next to Curie or on the opposite side of the kitchen across from her mimicking her behavior.

So, tldr, new doggo rescued on veterans day who has turned out to be the best doggo.

2020-11-15 10:49:10 : [Breeds] Looking for a high endurance, high energy breed for walking and running that will also be chill around cats. : doggerexplorer : https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/juk3v8/breeds_looking_for_a_high_endurance_high_energy/

Hello,  I am looking to get a puppy for the new year, and I need a little bit of help with finding the right breed for me. I have two main criteria, and they seem to be at odds with each other:

1. I want a buddy to keep me company on my hiking adventures.
2. But I also want a breed who will be tolerant of my cat.

I've had a look around on the internet, and from what I can gather, the best dog breeds for long hikes are the very same dog breeds with high prey drives that are really not good for living with cats. I realise that what determines the nature of the relationship between a dog and a cat is probably more to do with how they are introduced, raised, and trained, than with the intrinsic nature of the breeds, but because I will be a first-time dog owner I really want to set myself up with minimal opportunities for failure. My cat is a very sociable Ragdoll, who I am sure would love some non-human company, which I am sure will make this process a lot easier. I live with my parents and sister, and my mum has owned dogs when she was young, so she will be slightly familiar with training which I am sure will help. So can the good folks of r/dogs recommend any breeds for me to take a look at?

I have also included this questionnaire as recommended, but this introduction is really the brunt of my question :)

 \*\*Introduction\*\*  

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  

\* This will be my first dog. However

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?  

\* I do not have a preference.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.  

\* My ideal dog is a dog who can keep me company on my long hikes through the New Zealand wilderness, while also getting along well with my cat. I'd also love a dog who can accompany me on some longer distance runs through my neighbourhood. 

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  

\* I really have no idea what breeds would be good for me. I thought that the Rhodesian Ridgeback looked like a really cool breed, but I have read conflicting things about whether they are any good with cats or not. I also thought that the Vizsla and Bernese Mountain Dog looked like they had potential for me as well, but again I read some conflicting things about how well they work with cats. On top of that, I understand that the Viszla is prone to skin cancer? Which is really not good for New Zealand with our particular susceptibility to skin cancer, which I assume carries over to dogs as well. I am also slightly worried that the Bernese Mountain Dog may have too thick of a coat for New Zealand summers.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  

\* I only really want to be able to train my dog to act passive around my cat, to be able to go on walks without a leash, and to be able to play some games like fetch for exercise and whatnot.  

 6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?  

\* As I've said before, the hiking is the main thing. I have quite a bit of experience with relatively easy hikes around Auckland, and other coastal locations around New Zealand, and I also have a little bit of experience in some more rugged locations. I also enjoy running on a casual basis, and I would love to take my dog on runs with me. 

\*\*Care Commitments\*\*    

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  

\* This is a question that I'm struggling to find a concrete answer to. I am going to University next year, this is a huge new change in my life and as such I have no idea how much time I will have on my hands. I have always been an early riser and will definitely have time for at least an hour long run in the mornings before my lectures, but I really don't know how much time I will spend studying. However, I will be living and studying at home, and the dog will be a family dog as much as my own. As such, I think that my family will be able to make up for any lost time I have spent studying with training, playing or other interactions. 

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    

\* I am really into exercise and pride myself in keeping myself fit. I already spend at least an hour daily exercising which my dog will absolutely be able to join in on. I think I could find another hour at another point in the day for more exercise on top of this. My other family members will also have time to exercise my dog too.  I do not have a dog park within walking distance of my house, so I cannot see myself visiting one very often, however if I think they would be beneficial I would be happy to drive out to one. Most of the exercise would be going out for long runs and walks, and I always enjoyed playing fetch with my ex's dog, and I would love to be able to do that as well. I also live close to a beach, so swimming would be a possibility too. 

 9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

 \* I am willing to do quite a bit of regular brushing. I always take some time out of my day to relax and listen to music, and I think I could easily work some brushing into this time. Trimming hair I would be happy to do at home. As for cleaning ears, I am not sure exactly what this involves, but I would happy to learn and give it a go, and if not taking my dog to a professional would be no problem.

\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*  

10)	What size dog are you looking for?  

\* I really don't mind what size. 

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  

\* I would prefer to keep the shedding and slobber to a minimum, but if I am really drawn to a particular dog a could look past this. Barking doesn't matter to me. 

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  

\* This is very important to me, as I think hiking with my dog leashed would be very annoying. 

\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  

\* A snuggly dog would be nicer I think.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?  

\*  I think I would prefer a dog that is eager-to-please, but if it wants to do its own thing that's cool too. 

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?   

\* I would slightly prefer it if my dog was passive towards strangers, but this is something that I don't mind. 

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  

\* I do not see too many dogs out and about so this doesn't bother me too much.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?  

\* Not that I can think of.

\*\*Lifestyle\*\*  

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  

\* There will always be somebody in the house. 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   

\* Everybody in the house has said that they would love to take part in all aspects of taking care of a dog. Except for picking up the poos haha.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?  

\* As I said before, I have a Ragdoll cat.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  

\* The dog will almost never interact with children. 

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease? 

\* I have no plans on renting in the near future.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?  

\* I live in Auckland, New Zealand. I am not aware of any laws banning certain breeds. 

 24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?  

\* Average summer high: 24 degrees Celcius (75 fahrenheit). The average winter low is 8 degrees Celcius (46 fahrenheit) It is very humid in Auckland which makes this 24 degrees seem a lot higher. 

\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*  

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.  

\* No additional information.  

26) Feel free to ask any questions below.

2020-11-15 10:51:42 : My family officially will be living in Hinesburg! : itchyspiderbutthole : https://www.reddit.com/r/vermont/comments/juk4qh/my_family_officially_will_be_living_in_hinesburg/

We drove from California to Vermont with my elderly parents, four cats, a dog, and a baby. We stayed in airbnb houses the whole way, putting air filters in every night and staying isolated to prevent spreading is contracting covid. When we got to Vermont, we spent 2 weeks in quarantine. We are still living in an airbnb now, but our offer on a home was accepted and we are all so very excited. 

No more fire season and we are much closer to our family in upstate and western New York. We hated living in California, it was so hot and very little appreciation for nature. 

Best of all, we moved here after autumn, we saw only a tiny bit of the footage but mostly just the bare trees of early winter, which means we will be comfortable settled in our new home by the time we get to really appreciate the foliage!

2020-11-15 10:53:11 : Help needed buying a solid work/studying laptop : WebSlinger96 : https://www.reddit.com/r/Laptop/comments/juk594/help_needed_buying_a_solid_workstudying_laptop/

My partner’s looking to buy a laptop she can use for work, watching lectures and for an upcoming doctorate course so it’ll be quite heavily used at times. We’ve seen a good deal for an Acer Swift 3 with the latest AMD Ryzen 5, 8gb RAM and a 1tb SSD which seems a great deal, it even comes in purple which is a bit of a bonus. However we’ve read reviews of them being somewhat dim (between 212 and 230 nits) and there’s a bit of concern about this. Is this something to be worried about?

If you have recommendations for others, we’d like something with a decent amount of RAM, a good amount of storage (at least 512gb SSD) and something that will last a while with some heavy use. Budget probably up to £800 GBP

Here’s the link to what we’ve seen:

Hi,

Our new puppy is coming in a month, her mum is a black F1 labradoodle (looks like a lab) and dad is a chocolate lab.

From my research most labradoodles are 50/50 or more poodle, has anyone here got a pic of their dog that's closer to my mix? She looks like a lab now and I'm guessing that she always will!

Myself and my partner are shortly moving into our new home with a nice and big garden and have been looking around for a doodle to join our home. 

A sheepadoodle litter had come up locally and had never considered them before. From everything I've read they sound like amazing dogs and just what we are after. However, we both work and would mean they would be left on there own in the day. 

What are peoples experiences with this ?

Were we hoping to be able to create train them, and take them for a run/walk in the morning, and same in the evening. We have family local were can get to come walk and let our for the toilet in the day, if not we will look for the help of a dog walker etc.

My concern is making sure our life style is suited to the dog as much as anything. 

Thanks

2020-11-15 11:44:47 : FAKE PARENTS : Pepe_Philip : https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueScaryStories/comments/juko9q/fake_parents/

(DISCLAIMER, this did really happen to me. Idk why this keeps getting taken down.)

One day in the middle of the winter, when I was about 9 or 10 years old. My parents went away to visit some friends. This was the first time my little brother and I slept alone in our house. Because of this, my brother wanted me to sleep in his room to comfort him while our parents were gone. His bedroom was placed at the top of the stairs while the entrance door was at the bottom. So I could almost see the whole door while laying on the bed. After a few hours of being alone, my anxiety started to kick in and I texted my parents. I asked them if they were heading home anytime soon and they answered: "pretty soon". From their friend's house, it usually took an hour to drive home. So I laid there waiting for my parents to get home and my brother eventually fell asleep. After an hour I suddenly heard the doorknob from the front door slowly trying to open the door. I texted my parents asking if they wanted me to open the door, they replied "we're not home yet". I quickly realized that my parents weren't the people outside my door. I decided to lay as still as possible and decided to wait until my parents got home.

Eventually, my parents arrived and I told them everything. They told me that probably imagined it because of my fear of being alone. And we decided to go to bed. The day after, I went outside and looked at the ground. I could clearly see multiple footsteps in the snow leading up to the door and told my parents. They had talked to the neighbor and was told that the neighbor dog had woken up in the middle of the night and barked at some strangers outside the door. With this information, I got an idea to follow the footsteps outside my door. Then, I couldn't believe what I saw. Two pairs of footsteps walking from door to door throughout my whole street.

I don't know who they were or what they were up to. But, I imagine that it maybe was some robbers trying to find an empty house or open door to a house to rob.

2020-11-15 11:47:46 : The history behind the usage and further meaning of momento mori? : D3thklok1985 : https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/jukp9x/the_history_behind_the_usage_and_further_meaning/

I know it means remember that you die/will die, and was written in Socrates journal. I find my own personal interpretation from this as it reminds me of my struggle with depression and trauma. I was thinking of getting this as a tattoo on my collar bone. 
But with any translated or very old phrase, I want to research more about it before maybe learning it's a dog whistle for something, has a specific or different context than I thought or affiliated with something I wouldn't agree with. Could anyone provide some more context or maybe their thoughts when you see this phrase?

Would this be any way offensive or inappropriate as a tattoo?

2020-11-15 11:50:04 : Freeze drying your pet.. : Kittystar111 : https://www.reddit.com/r/Petloss/comments/jukq3e/freeze_drying_your_pet/

**My Question:** Has anyone freeze dried their pet's body? Or know anyone that has? I can't bear the thought of burning my dog's body out of existence. My family is against it and pissed at me for considering it.

**My Story:** Sorry for the super long rant but I literally have no one to talk to and no where to go.

My dog Pixie passed 6 days ago. I am distraught. I have literally no reason to live anymore. My life was for her. I am 32, disabled with a whole host of physical and mental issues, and I live with my parents who I've always had a terrible relationship with no matter how hard I try. Everything I had in my life is gone.. my career, my fiance, my friends, everything slowly disappeared as my health problems appeared and kept declining. Pixie was there with me through all of it. I thought of suicide many times but I would never leave Pixie alone. I was her world. She stuck to me like glue. She always had to be touching me somehow with her body pressed against mine. 2 years ago she was diagnosed with TCC bladder cancer. She handled her chemo great with never an issue. One day she stopped eating. Several days passed with her not eating. For some stupid reason I just thought she must have a stomach ache and she will get better. Took her to the vet... her kidneys were failing. One was gone, the other working at 40%. She had gotten SARS bacteria in her urethra from having a staph infection on her skin since she peed so much because of her bladder cancer. She had to take a strong antibiotic. She got better!!! This happened once more and again she got better. This 3rd time... she didn't. And it's my fault. This time she had 3 bacterias causing a huge infection in her kidney. The thing is... she was doing GREAT. I took her to the vet because her urine was smelling horrendous. For weeks I couldn't breath. The intense stench of ammonia fumes was stuck in the air no matter how much I cleaned. I barely slept because I had to mop the floor all day and all night and change the bedsheets during the day and in the middle of the night as soon as they started smelling because she had started to leak urine. I ended up having to go to the hospital because I passed out from not being able to breath. I had ammonia poisoning in my lungs. So I took her to the vet simply because her pee smelled and I wanted to make sure she was okay and I couldnt handle the literal poison it was causing me. She was prescribed 2 strong antibiotics both of them 3 times a day. I'm assuming it destroyed her stomach because within a a few days she stopped eating but her urine smelled slightly better so I think it was working. But she would only eat a few pieces of food. I STUPIDLY thought I should give her a break so her stomach heals and I felt bad so I didnt give it to her for a few days. She got better. When I started it back up... she never got better. I didn't know what to do. Should I skip some doses so she can have a break? Should I not give it to her at all? Should I keep forcing it until she gets better? I gave her less doses. Partially because I fely bad and partially because I was so selfishly inside my own head full of frustrations of my life in general and of how much I was having to clean and feel more sick than usual from the lack of sleep. And now I feel like I killed her because of that. My mom would tell me I had to force her to eat with a syringe and I wouldnt do it. I felt bad for her because she feared the syringe. She slowly declined over the next 2 weeks and her last 2 days she was so sad. I was going to take her to the vet in the morning and randomly in the middle of the night she couldnt breath. She was panting and breathing fast gasping for air. It would come and go. I started having panic attacks so I put on my headphones, laid her next to me, and watched a movie trying to drown out the fear. And I feel like absolute shit because I feel like I was sitting there selfishly watching a movie while my dog was slowly dying next to me. At 7AM she started gasping badly and she couldnt get up I knew then she couldnt breath and she was going to start having seizures as I had seen it in someone else's dog before. She was so scared laying there looking at me gasping and twitching. I could see her trying to stay calm and asking for help but her little body just couldn't take it. I called an at home euthanasia vet and asked them to rush over for an emergency and thank god they did. 

I hate myself and I feel guilty for so many reasons. I feel like I killed her. I feel like I treated her so poorly in her last few weeks because of my selfishness and frustration. We lived our life together in my bed as I said I am disabled so we spent most of our time there with her attached to me. When she started leaking the foul smelling urine I had to place a pee pad and blankets under her and keep her off of my body because the urine would burn my skin. So even though she was still laying there right next to me always.. it wasn't the same for her. Sometimes she would look at me like she didn't understand why I wouldn't let her lay right on top of me like she always has. Why did I wait so long to take her to the vet? Why did I skip medication doses? Why couldn't I find the selflessness to clean her after she urinated every single time to make sure she didn't get any infections? Why didn't I force feed her like my mom told me too? I started putting in too little effort too late. Poor little Pixie her last night was spent with me forcing her to eat and her laying there next to me in bed having trouble breathing and looking so lonely. I shouldve known it was her last day. I shouldve held her and took pictures and let her know she was loved so she could have one last good memory.

All of my "problems" seem so stupid now. All I could think about how frustrated I was about my health, my living situation, and how much I wanted the smell of her urine to go away. Im such a piece of shit. And I will never be able to show her how sorry I am and how much I love her. I should have held her and kissed her more in her last couple weeks instead of getting aggravated. I spent her whole life spoiling her and in her moments when she truly needed me, when giving her love truly mattered, I failed her. Poor Pixie was laying there on my bed by herself while my parents forced me to clean my room enough to be presentable before the vet got here. Poor Pixie was laying there staring at me in fear. She didn't understand what was happening. She looked so sad and scared and lonely like she was begging me for help. And her face, her poor little face.. she didn't look like she wanted to go.. not at all. She looked like she was begging me to help her, to hold her and make her better. And I couldn't do anything. I just sat there next to her on our bed while she was being put to sleep and poor Pixie's eyes staring at me intensely just begging for help. I should have held her during the process so she felt loved. All she got was me sitting there with a mask on. That was her last image and feeling. Me with a fucking mask on so she couldn't even see half my face, and me not holding her in her greatest time of need. 

After she passed I held her, and I cried, and I told her how sorry I was for everything I did wrong, and I told her how much I loved her. But I don't know if she knew. Dogs don't have the thought pattern of "well maybe she's not treating me like she usually does but she's loved me and spoiled me for the past 12 years so its ok!" I think in her last 2 weeks she thought I didn't love her anymore. And maybe she gave up on trying to fight because of that, because of me. Her last few days she wasn't wagging her tail, she wasn't begging for food, whenever I gave her kisses she didn't give me any back. I still keep bringing her food bowl to the kitchen with me but shes not there to eat. I still keep looking under my blankets to give her kisses but shes not there. I feel like such a piece of shit of a person and I feel like cremating her would be the ultimate betrayal to her. Years ago I had already decided I was going to freeze dry her body. And now that the time is here I am being pushed to cremate her. I can't bear the thought of her body no longer "existing" I can't bear the thought of never being able to see her physical form again. And I can't bear the thought of setting her on fire after all the suffering she already went through. I feel like she would want to be able to sit in my room with me even in death in her actual body instead of as a pile of dust trapped in a jar. Other people have their lives, their spouses, their children, their jobs, their other pets etc. I have literally nothing. All I had was Pixie and all she had was me. And I feel like I didn't give her what she deserved. 

Anyway my parents are screaming at me daily to hurry up and get her cremated and they rage every time I say I want to do the freeze drying preservation. In case you don't know what it is, it is not taxidermy. They take your pet and put it in a type of freezer and it dehydrates the body so it takes out all the moisture and the body stays that way "frozen" forever. My dad says it's an outrage and that Pixie has suffered enough and she just wants to be home with me already. My mom says its disgusting and that I'm sick and crazy and that I will regret it and probably be scared of it. I don't know what to do. I'm terrified of both choices and which one will I regret more.

 I will never again be able to show her how much I love her and how sorry I am that I didn't give her the love she deserved in her last week of life. And I want to at least do the last thing I can do for her correctly. I took poor Pixie for granted. I just expected her to get better like she always had. I didn't take enough pictures. The entire house feels empty and quiet (aside from my parents screaming at me or each other). I don't feel her presence like other people say they do with their pets. I have no reason to wake up, or to eat, or to live. I will never know if she was happy, or if she knew I loved her, or how long she may have stayed if I hadn't fucked up her medication doses even though the vet said she might not have recovered that time anyway I will never know if I killed my dog. My body feels heavy and weak. I don't even have the energy or desire to talk outloud. I look around my room at her toys, at her bowl, at her blanket and she's not there. And my parents are expecting me to be fine. I feel so bad for poor Pixie. She was so innocent and small and she deserved better. I need to do right by her and her body but I don't know what right is.

2020-11-15 11:50:33 : [Scheduled/Evergreen] The War of the Worlds : GeminiPenguin : https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/jukqae/scheduledevergreen_the_war_of_the_worlds/

  

Hey, Earthlings! Glad to have you here for the first part this discussion. (Book 1 Chapter 1 – Book 1 the end of chapter 9.)

A quick summary of what we’ve read so far: 

**Chapter One (The Eve of the War):** In the late 1800s while the folks on Earth are going about their normal lives the planet of Mars has cooled forcing its inhabitants to seek a new home to call their own. They’ve set their sights on Earth and are ready to fight for it. Over the course of 10 nights they send 10 projectiles barreling toward Earth. It takes the newspapers a bit to pick up on anything happening so far away. 

**Chapter Two (The Falling Star):** When the attack starts the locals take it for a falling star. Ogilvy convinced the meteorite must be nearby goes in search of it. Upon finding it and discovering signs of life he connects The Thing with the flash on Mars. The heat radiating from the foreign missile won’t allow him close enough to help. Curious and wanting to help those inside Ogilvy takes off for help. It’s early in the morning and most of the folks he encounters do not believe his wild tale. Then he lucks upon seeing Henderson, a journalist in his garden. Being a journalist he is at least curious enough about the story to follow Ogilvy back to the site. Upon closer examination the men decide anyone inside the cylinder must be insensible or dead. The pair return to town in search of help. The journalist telegraphs a London newspaper and once the story is published folks begin coming to see ‘the dead men from Mars.’

**Chapter Three (On Horsell Common):** Our narrator arrives at the Commons to find that Ogilvy and Henderson aren’t there. He finds boys sitting on the rails and makes them stop throwing stones at the cylinder. There was a small crowd of what our narrator calls common people who he guesses have very little knowledge about Mars or other astronomical events. He also believes the yellow-white metal to be extraterrestrial. He doesn’t believe there is a man inside, but more probable a manuscript that would be hard to translate into languages known on Earth.

He returns to the pit that afternoon to find that Ogilvy and Henderson have been joined by Stent, the Royal Astronomer. Stent is directing a crew of men to ‘unearth’ the now cooler cylinder. The crowd was getting anxious and narrator was asked to find Lord Hilton who wasn’t at home.   

**Chapter Four (The Cylinder Opens):** Our narrator arrives back at the pit. The crowd is unruly and shoving each other inside the pit in the attempt to see more. One young man is knocked in and tries to use the cylinder as a way to scramble back out as the cylinder begins to open. The crowd runs away as our narrator watches the Martian come out looking nothing like the ‘man’ he believes most people expected to see. The sight of the alien with the V shaped mouth and fungoid oily brown skin fills him with dread and disgust.  He doesn’t run until the first falls out and another of the aliens appears behind the first. He believes the shopkeeper who was pushed in earlier to be the first victim of the aliens. He’s too terrified to attempt to rescue him. 

**Chapter Five (The Heat Ray):** Our narrator doesn’t run far from the pit. He walks in curve unable to look away from the creatures and the happenings. He’s joined by other stunned spectators. A group of men wave a white flag to show the Martians Earthlings are intelligent creatures like them. 

While this is going on a humped shape arises with flickering beams of light coming from it. Then flashes of fire light begin to cut down the closest onlookers. The heat ray continues cutting down people and natural obstacles in its way. Our narrator survives this only because the heat ray doesn’t make a full circle around the pit as he stands gawking at what he called “death leaping from person to person.” The men waving the white flag, including, Ogilvy are killed by the heat ray making its rounds.

**Chapter Six (The Heat Ray in the Chobham Road):** At the beginning of this chapter our narrator tells us that he doesn’t know (nor does anyone to his knowledge) how the heat rays work. All he knows is they are deadly and invisible until something they fit bursts into flames. There is a theory about how it might work, but it’s unproven.

He travels away from the pit to find an area where mounted policemen are being booed as they follow the instructions of the Royal Astronomer, Stent, to attempt to keep people away from the cylinder. Stent sent a telegraph to warn them before his demise at the white flag along with Henderson and Olgivy.

The Martians advance and people are trampled as others try to escape death by heat ray.

**Chapter Seven (How I Reached Home):** Our narrator travels home half confused and definitely in a state of shock. He encounters a group of disbelievers who he doesn’t try to enlighten. It’s only once he arrives home, he tells the truth to his wife. She’s horrified and our narrator tries to assure her that if worse comes to worse, the Earthlings will just have to kill all the invaders. 

**Chapter Eight (Friday Night):** Our narrator is astounded on how people through his town are going about their regular life despite what happened at the pit with only a little novel discussion of the Martian’s arrival. All the while the creatures can be heard hammering and readying their machines. Soldiers begin to assemble and the second cylinder arrives on Earth.

**Chapter Nine (The Fighting Begins):** After a night of poor sleep our narrator wakes up to find his wife still sleeping and the milkman and a neighbor gossiping about the aliens. The milkman claims they should be taken alive while the neighbor working in their garden says ‘they make themselves unapproachable.’ The chapter ends with the world behind them being burnt down by the Martian attack.

He encounters a group of soldiers and explains what he saw the night before and the heat ray. The men immediately begin to discuss how to attack/kill the Martians. 

Then the aliens launch another attack, and this makes our narrator realize he and his wife will be in danger if they remain at their house. He rents a horse and dog cart from someone for two pounds with the promise of returning it. He, his wife, and their servant leave towards Leatherhead.

I don’t know about you guys, but the heat ray gave me chills! You can’t see it until it hits something! 

Below in the comments are some discussion questions. Feel free to give your thoughts on some or all of them and/or discuss anything else about his book that caught your attention/made you speculate.

2020-11-15 11:50:51 : Do tulpa systems experience dissociation/amnesia? : frcgdad_ : https://www.reddit.com/r/Tulpas/comments/jukqf1/do_tulpa_systems_experience_dissociationamnesia/

I’m part of an OSDD system though I’m kind of new to the plural community. I was curious about this, and I don’t know much about tulpas/thoughtforms so please excuse my ignorance.

To tulpa systems experience dissociation/amnesia? I was curious because in traumagenic systems dissociation/amnesia is caused by PSTD, but since endogenic systems typically don’t have PTSD do they still dissociate/have amnesia?

I’m especially curious because since I’m part of a OSDD-1b system we don’t have as severe amnesia or dissociation, and I was wondering if tulpa systems were the same/similar in that way.

Not so much a rant as it is a vent 

So I’ve been actively working towards getting a service dog this year, since in January I had a horrible panic attack in a pet friendly farmers market, and my dog was able to help calm me down with dpt and distractions. Ever since that day I’ve realized that having a service dog would give me so much of my independence back that I’ve lost due to a past experience I’d rather not go into, as my anxiety at the beginning of the year was so bad I couldn’t make it through a grocery trip without having to walk out and take break because I was too overwhelmed, a couple months ago when I finally got the courage to tell my therapist about my idea, she told me that first my anxiety wasn’t “Debilitating enough” to warrant one, I disagreed, and pointed that out to her trying to figure out why she didn’t believe it was debilitating? (I was fully willing to listen, I figured she had some other form of help, as I had already tried journaling, meds, meditation, breathing exercises and more with little to no results aside from either feeling like a zombie, just over thinking more, or hyperventilating) She then tells me that anxiety isn’t a reason to warrant a service dog in her opinion. I was shocked to hear her say this. I left that day not wanting to go back, because it felt like she had just said she didn’t think anxiety was a disability. I’ve been trying to switch therapists but it’s taking a while. But is she right?? Does anxiety warrant a service dog?? I just want a safety net for public spaces, but am I truly just not “disabled enough”? When I first started this journey I was under the impression I might not deserve one because all I had was pretty bad anxiety, but through the year I’ve been trying to tell myself that yeah I do deserve it, my disability makes it so I can’t go out and have a lunch with friends, I deserve to be able to go into a store and leave once I’ve finished my shopping. I deserve to have the safety net there to keep me safe if I do have a panic attack. And I deserve to have the calming knowledge that even if I do get over whelmed my dog can help. But now I’m back to square one, because what if I’m taking away a service dog from someone who needs it more?? Idk I just have a lot of doubts, it’d be nice to get some assurance either way.

2020-11-15 11:53:28 : My dream : historyismental : https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/jukrev/my_dream/

So last night I had a dream about how my grandfather died, now I like history as u can tell by my name, so the dream goes on he sadly passes away. I wake up with a scared fear, like someone is here, my dog runs away and I turn onto my right and fall asleep. I woke up at 8oclock and didn't get up till 9 since its the weekend. I search up on my phone around 9am, what does it mean to dream about a deceased family member and I found. Out that if you wake up with a fear that means someone was in your room after you woke up from your dream, then they are. I freaked out and just realised that feeling in my room was my grandad.       So this is a real dream and it amazed me.

2020-11-15 11:53:40 : HGE diagnosed dog who passed - Am I right to be upset? : FormalNoodle : https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/jukrib/hge_diagnosed_dog_who_passed_am_i_right_to_be/

Hello! My dog passed about two weeks ago from  hemorrhagic gastroenteritis (HGE). 

-Species: Dog
-Age: 8
-Sex/Neuter status: Female, was spayed
-Breed: Lab/Pitt/mutt mix 
-Body weight: 70
-History: No history of diseases/sickness
-Your general location: Virginia, USA

My partner and I came home from the store and found that our dog had bled on the carpet. We isolated her from our other dog to see who was the one getting sick and places puppy pads down. She continued to have straight bloody stool. We quickly took her to an emergency vet who did lab tests, scans and more of her. They said she would be okay and sent her home with medication and said to feed her rice/chicken/veggies with medicine. She wouldn’t eat or take the medication, so we called back a day later to figure out what we could do. They suggested baby food, treats, PB, etc and so we bought a lot of options to try. Still no luck, and they say to bring her in the next day if things get worse but she should be okay but will be in pain without the medicine. We go to bed after spending some time with her, and in the morning we found that she passed during the night. 

I can provide pictures of the diagnoses/the stool/anything else needed if anyone wants it. 

Upon further research, we learned that it’s very common for vets to keep HGE diagnosed animals in their care to administer medication, give fluids through drip, and monitor closely and that normally with this care they are likely to survive. 

So, are we right to be upset? Is there something we can do about this after the fact? Or was this the vets way to say she was too far gone to care for and to spend time at home with her? Did we do something wrong?

2020-11-15 11:54:50 : [Discussion] Do established dogs rub off on new puppies? : BestBarnacle0 : https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/jukrxw/discussion_do_established_dogs_rub_off_on_new/

Our Pom puppy is 11 weeks. We got him at 8 weeks on the dot.

He is just so... good? 

He holds his pee and poo until he can get to his pads and has since 9 weeks (can't take him outside, neighbor dog just had parvo), he sleeps through the night, only whimpers a little if he's alone, only really chews on his toys, is extremely easy to teach things to... okay, he is "chompy," but that's it really and he is already a million times better about chomping than he was when we got him.

Our established dog is really good too, and was an easy puppy. He has been an excellent big brother! Is it possible that he is "leading the way" and that's part of why our puppy is an angel? 

I was expecting mega puppy blues as I'm easily stressed and hate commitment, but this is a...... breeze...? I'm almost afraid to jinx it LOL

2020-11-15 11:55:46 : The unexpected has happened 🥰 : letatsauvage : https://www.reddit.com/r/puppy101/comments/juksah/the_unexpected_has_happened/

My wife and I have a 6.5 year old Labrador who, even though she grew up with other dogs, she has never actually played with them. After a few incidents of off leash dogs attacking her when she was a puppy, she’s always been hesitant and then just unbothered by other dogs. She basically ignores them.

We brought a new puppy home 3 weeks ago and our best hope was that she would tolerate her. After 2 weeks she actually started playing with her, and is just absolutely gentle and sweet to her. Our hearts are so happy ❤️

We’re still amazed to see it happening every day

2020-11-15 12:00:32 : [Fluff] My husband shaved my husky : hartsoul : https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/juku7u/fluff_my_husband_shaved_my_husky/

This is long but I wanna give lots of info here...

First let me start out by saying that the dog is really mine. I grew up with tons of pets and am a huge animal person. My husband grew up with no pets and when we got together expected like to get a cat, maybe two.... We have 3 dogs, 5 cats, bunnies and ferrets lol

I am pretty much the sole care taker of the pets. My husband enjoys the dogs and cats and I can get him to feed/water and take them out when I'm at work but besides that it's all me. He will play and snuggle the dogs. Honestly our small dog is far more bonded to him actually lol

Anyways having a lot of pets is time consuming but had never been an issue before....

But my health took a sudden and scary turn. I had some severe mysterious health issues that the doctors couldn't figure out at first. I was in and out of the hospital and ER a ton. I'm now on medication that makes me extremely tired and sick. Super fun!

Well my husky is a long coated husky and I had always brushed him myself. I'm not good at it. I've bought all the brushes and have a good routine but even with daily brushing I never felt he was perfectly done with his undercoat.

He also came from a very bad situation. He basically was bought from a bad BYB as a puppy and the owner liked the idea of a husky but not the reality... He lived in a small bedroom. Never taken on walks or given any adequate exercise a husky needs. I got him and have had him 5 years now. He is reactive but with a lot of work he is way better than he was! But still I use a muzzle when taking him to the vet. He just gets very fearful and it's just an incase.

Well as I got sick I decided to get a groomer. Well between living in a small town, him needing to wear a muzzle and covid that has been a nightmare. So many groomers near me only do small dogs. 95% of the groomers I called refused to see him because of the muzzle. I don't even understand why as that's the whole point of a muzzle so he can't bite. Even with a vet reference saying they see him and adore him and he has never bitten anyone and is even friendly and licks them he is just very fearful. And I have the correct nice proper fitting bite proof muzzle.

So as you might be able to tell I was frustrated. The only groomers I found was a lady that seemed shady and was super rude to me on the phone and a groomer an hour away that is booked for the next three months because of covid.

So yeah I was upset and even cried about it.

Well my darling husband decided to try and help me out as a surprise. 

He tried brushing him and brushed and brushed and brushed and it barely put a dent in it lol so he decided to just shave a bit here and there. Not realizing you aren't supposed to shave a husky. Now it's important to note I do shave down just slightly around his bum. So perhaps that's why he thought this was ok... idk

But apparently he just kept not getting it right and kept saying a little bit more here and there until... He completely shaved him down. Not bald but this absurd very short, bald spot looking like a 2 year old cut their own hair disjointed look. It is so bad.

Just stop and imagine my shock and surprise coming home to that....

The thought was absolutely sweet and it's so hard to be mad but also omg! Oh my God....

I wanna cry and laugh. I just had to share this.

2020-11-15 12:01:30 : Trump's acting DHS secretary was unlawfully appointed and didn't have the authority to suspend DACA, a federal judge ruled : autotldr : https://www.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/jukumj/trumps_acting_dhs_secretary_was_unlawfully/

This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://www.businessinsider.com/federal-judge-dhs-chad-wolf-lacked-authority-to-suspend-daca-2020-11) reduced by 23%. (I'm a bot)
*****
&gt; NEW YORK - A federal judge in New York ruled Saturday that Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf assumed his position unlawfully, a determination that invalidated Wolf&amp;#039;s suspension of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which shields young people from deportation.

&gt; Karen Tumlin, an attorney who represented a plaintiff in one of two lawsuits that challenged Wolf&amp;#039;s authority, called the ruling &amp;quot;Another win for DACA recipients and those who have been waiting years to apply for the program for the first time."

&gt; Wolf issued a memorandum in July effectively suspending DACA, pending review by DHS. A month earlier, the US Supreme Court had ruled that President Donald Trump failed to follow rule-making procedures when he tried to end the program, but the justices kept a window open for him to try again.

&gt; In August, the Government Accountability Office, a bipartisan congressional watchdog, said Wolf and his acting deputy, Ken Cuccinelli, were improperly serving and ineligible to run the agency under the Vacancies Reform Act.

&gt; In Garaufis&amp;#039; ruling Saturday, the judge wrote that DHS didn&amp;#039;t follow an order of succession established when then-Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen resigned in April 2019.

&gt; DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the ruling.

2020-11-15 12:09:56 : [help] I’m having concerns my pup is from a puppy farm : heyitsme2412 : https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/juky1g/help_im_having_concerns_my_pup_is_from_a_puppy/

Hi. So, 7 months ago in April we bought a lovely little cockapoo pup. All seemed legit and we brought him home. He was healthy happy and he was with us for an amazing 6 months before getting into an awful accident he very sadly passed at 8 months old. My whole family was absolutely heartbroken. Just about a month later an ad for golden doodle puppies popped up and we thought it would be good as it’s not the exact same as a cockapoo but still has the poodle mix. We messaged them and organised to meet them the next day and hopefully buy the pup. We got to meet them at their house and there was 2 gorgeous wee pups left in the litter. We didn’t know many red flags about puppy farms as we had only bought one pup and didn’t do any deep research beforehand (big regrets, I feel absolutely awful). We first asked how many were in the litter but the woman seemed a bit simple and said “aw I can’t remember I’ve been isolating for 10 days away with my boyfriend and haven’t been here.” That was the first red flag, we didn’t know any better at this point but it did made us think ‘what??’ Anyway, she showed us the pups and they were absolutely adorable. There was 2 left (which is why we were asking how many was in the litter). We picked the one we wanted and he was adorable. But here was the next red flag (also didn’t know at the time) there was another litter of black puppies about 2 weeks younger than the puppy we bought. That didn’t exactly make me feel uneasy, I thought they just had other dogs and I moved on. We then asked to see the parents which they showed us them and it seemed legit, but for all we know it might not have been the parents. We saw children walking about and there were other family dogs as well, it seemed like a good environment. We got the vet papers and they had had their first injections, but they hadn’t been microchipped. They told us they didn’t get them registered because the poodle (dad) was given to the woman and hadn’t been registered before. We also didn’t realise this was a red flag and handed the money over and left. It was then in the car we talked about some of the things and realised the possibility of a puppy farm. Also in the car ride home, we realised the puppies were only 7 weeks old, but the ad said 8 weeks. I also researched some more and I began to feel absolutely awful. We have had him for 3 weeks now and looking at him sometimes makes me feel sick to the stomach. We got him vet checked and taken in to get microchipped and the vets said everything was fine and he was healthy. He eats all his food well and loves to play. He has good temperament and he does like to bite but nothing aggressive. I think it was either an uneducated family looking to make a quick buck or the pups came from a puppy farm and the woman had to upload an ad and sell them. There is a part of me thinking that it wasn’t a puppy farm, just uneducated breeders that meant no harm as they did have the pups vaccinated. But a deeper part of me is thinking it was some sort of puppy farm as they weren’t microchipped and there was another litter. I did feel a tiny bit under pressure  to buy the pup as my children were with me and were so excited to get this pup, especially after losing the last. But I feel like a monster now as a part of me felt uneasy when I was there buying the pup but I ignored it as I thought I was overthinking and my daughter was already attached. I feel so awful and sick to my stomach. There was no “return” papers either and there’s not much we can do. Do you think it was a puppy mill? Or just an uneducated family. What should I do? The pup seems perfectly healthy and hasn’t had any problems health wise. Thank you in advance. (Just a side note: I’m very against puppy mills, I have now done my research and there is a place in hell for anyone who enforces it. I knew of puppy mills before but I wasn’t very educated on them, thanks)

 My design for Bunyip would be a massive hairy starfish that can shape-shift it's five limbs into arms, legs and a head resembling a large hairy tusked dog creature, it has large sloth-like claws on each of the arms and two black blots resembling eyes with spikes underneath. It is said that Titanus Bunyip's thick and stretchy simple limbs can easily be melded into a variety of shapes, Due to the titan being a giant starfish, it's a reference to one of it's popular descriptions and that is the starfish.

* (Just like how it's mimicking a different creature before revealing it's true form, bit like a shapeshifter.)

So, what do you think?

Hi, I'm a wee lad from EU, I'd like to meet someone to chat with, be friend with or maybe something more. I've definitely rambled round me mind a lot about posting on here, but I've just felt like it was the right thing to do.

These days I spend decent amount of my time online besides doing my chores and taking doggo for walks. I'd usually be chatting with friends using Discord but most of them are quite busy these days, so that's why I'm here to make new friends. It'd be awesome if you could interest me in new music genres, bands, videogames, series, yt channels etc.

Music wise I'm more of old school rock and metal type a guy, but I have favourite bands or performers all around various music genres.

I mostly play coop, fps and strategy videogames so if you're a pc gamer, maybe we could play something.

Currently I'm waiting for the new episode of The Good Doctor to drop, because it's so good, but that's just my humble opinion. Usually I'll watch some documentaries.

Please do not message me if you're bored or seek a short entertainment, let's not waste each others time. If you use Discord, I'll give you my username, pls if you're about to message be 18+.

Hopefully I'll see ya in the chat, I wish you all a good day/night! 🙂

2020-11-15 12:14:07 : My 16 year old relationship is over : LongTermLost : https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/jukzl0/my_16_year_old_relationship_is_over/

As the title says, my(34m) 16 year relationship is potentially crumbling in front of me and I'm really struggling to come to terms with it. I'm not sure what I'm really looking for with this post other then to get it off my chest I guess.

A little back story, we got together when we were around 18 after meeting in an online chat room (yes I know), it was a long distance relationship that we made work despite a few rocky points and unfortunately as young stupid kids we ended up with a pregnancy on our hands. I moved to live with her and her mum for a few years until we were in a position to get ourselves sorted financially, since then we've bought a home and got a dog.

If I'm honest, we've never really had a strong relationship, we've had a lot of intimacy issues (a lack of) and whilst I think there is fault on both sides I know I've taken her for granted and could have done more.

We're still very early in this and I'm trying to be as understanding as I can because I don't doubt this has been hard for her to finally come out and tell me. My biggest problem so far is that I'm really struggling to accept that this is truly over. I've told her this of course and I've tried to tell her that I think we should try some sort of counselling for both us and myself but I could tell almost instantly it's too late for that for her. She's told me this twice now but I keep kidding myself that if I just try to be a better person I can change her mind. 

One of my biggest issues with all of this is I'm a little bit of a loner. I've always had self confidence issues and struggle in social environments so I don't really have anyone I can talk to  about any of this. My parents are the kind of people that won't react well to this and will take it as an opportunity to attack her for any and all reasons, probably thinking they are doing it for the right reasons but when I do truly believe I love this women it's not what I need to hear right now.

2020-10-29 16:11:34 : Joint pain at 23 years old? : theoatpie123 : https://www.reddit.com/r/DiagnoseMe/comments/jkcyd5/joint_pain_at_23_years_old/

Hi, I'm a 23 year old female and just wanted some opinions. About three or so weeks ago I started having moderate pain in my right foot where I had broken it around 2011, but then the pain started to spread more. I had originally fractured my fourth metatarsal growth plate and my fifth metatarsal bone, but the pain has begun to spread more upward of my foot and to my ankle. I did have surgery on my right foot in 2014 to remove an extra navicular bone (I have this extra bone in my left foot as well, but without much complication). This past week my left foot has started to hurt as well. Now the joint soreness and pain has spread to other joints (mainly my knees and my hand/wrist). I was told by podiatrists previously that I would end up with arthritis at some point in my feet, but now I'm worried that something else is causing all of this pain. I had scheduled an appointment with a podiatrist for next week for my right foot pain, but now that the pain is spreading I'm unsure if I should see a different doctor. I also have a bump on the top of my right foot at the base of my fifth metatarsal bone towards my ankle, it's rather small but it has been there for a long time. The pain in my fingers and wrist isn't very severe, if anything it feels more like a minor throbbing/burning sensation that is just super annoying but tolerable. Any thoughts on if I should just see the podiatrist and see what they say or if I should try going to a primary care doctor?

Hello everyone! My name is Rob, I'm the founder of Qualify For Solar, we are a small tech startup who's aim is to revolutionize the way customers and renewable energy providers engage.

We believe that the current industry standards are not transparent, and rely on shady marketing tactics.

So we are set out to change that by introducing free, up-front, 100% transparent tools and information to help consumers make better informed decisions, without accidentally selling their information to marketers and regretting the decision to "learn more about solar" as is often the case in this industry.

Feel free to ask me any personal questions you have and I'll happily respond to them as soon as possible.

In the meantime, check out Google's free service here: [https://www.google.com/get/sunroof](https://www.google.com/get/sunroof)

You simply type the address you want to see, and if they've covered that area with their heat signatures yet, then you'll be able to visualize it as well as receive a rough estimate on projected savings.

It is not entirely accurate and still I've seen mistakes on it, but it is a good tool to get started when you're trying to decide about whether solar is a good fit for your home or property.

I simply want to remove the barriers and make it easier for customers to achieve this. We are working with a small team to develop software and new integrative technologies that will definitely make it more mainstream and help connect investors, consumers, companies, and the public sectors alike.

Thanks for taking an interest in renewable energy! The future of our planet relies on our education and action!

For the uninitiated, DC's Act of God was a brief series where everyone's powers - regardless of origin - simply shut off.  Alien biology, magical prowess, radiation, Atlantean physiology, whatever; if you were not a baseline human, you were immediately made one.  The only heroes left unscathed were those that utilized technology and training in their crimefighting (read: only a certain pointy-eared Gothamite could still operate)

If this same event were to happen with Marvel characters - again, regardless of origin - how would things play out?

I went to essence yesterday and was denied access because my medcard was from out of state, they tried to confiscate my nonresident medical declaration saying, “who gave you this, your not allowed to have this” (I got it from the grove dispensary after making a purchase earlier that morning), I went over to Sahara wellness and had no issues whatsoever. Has anyone else every experienced this? It blows my mind that a dispensary with such a high repertoire is so out of touch with the reciprocity laws of their state

Me and a few friends are going ghost hunting tomorrow for a bit of a Halloween spook, going to a supposedly haunted location where a soldier was killed, a husband burned his wife alive and someone also killed themselves on the property where they were also buried, as someone who killed themselves weren't allowed to be buried in a graveyard at the time. It's a pretty old house, people have reported seeing someone in the trees beside it, and stones being thrown at people. One of the rooms remained locked presumably the room where the person commited suicide, a few paranormal investigators have visited the location. It is quite far away from the main road and requires a long walk. What should we do to maintain our safety and try to invoke some sort of activity?

Hello guys,

[https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCards/comments/hb5xkb/denied\_for\_chase\_freedom\_fico\_763\_and\_75k\_income/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCards/comments/hb5xkb/denied_for_chase_freedom_fico_763_and_75k_income/)

This is my previous post. Basically Chase wanted to see income verification for my first Chase card and I got approved later (Freedom).

I applied for Freedom Flex the other day, 4 months after getting the first card. However, it showed me the classic "We'll send mail" response. So I called recon and they are asking for income verification again? I thought 4 months would be enough record for them to believe me and I already provided income verification 4 months ago so it would be good but guess not. 

It's also super annoying that they only accept the verification via mail or fax... I don't have printer because who needs one these days? I'm literally going through extra steps for each card from Chase and I'm not sure if that's all worth it as I am planning to get the Freedom Unlimited and Sapphire down the road. Guess they will trust me by then? I'm just thinking about hoping onto Amex after this (or do they do the same thing??).

2020-10-29 16:11:51 : Side by side: Building sideboard on Penny Dreadful : Takeoutree : https://www.reddit.com/r/PennyDreadfulMTG/comments/jkcykv/side_by_side_building_sideboard_on_penny_dreadful/

[Original article.](https://mtg.cardsrealm.com/articles/side-by-side:-construindo-sideboard-no-penny-dreadful)

# In this week's article we will explore tips and various pieces for a good sideboard on Penny Dreadful, in addition to that summary and the decklists of the week.  

  
Ending the 4th weekend of season 18, with the next 10 weeks still to come (quantity expected for the next rotation), let's talk in today's article about a very important topic that can define matches, the sideboard.  If you don't like to build a deck from scratch, or maybe you even like to create but you don't think you have much experience, to help you, I bring here the most used cards on the decks that are working, the proportions and also some ideas that can be used to generate more value from your post side strategy. 

Before starting talking about the cards, it is important to reinforce that a good side is one that can deal with several strategies effectively. Remember that you will normally exchange 4 to 7 cards between games, which are several copies of the same card, exchanging only 1 card will not make you draw exactly this card in the middle of 60 during the entire game. Maybe that's why, many of the decks that made top1 have more focused and less diversified sideboards (used 2 to 3 sets of 4 cards to have a post side consistency) this I think is the &gt;!first tip: !&lt;**focus your side, put only 1 card for dealing with each problem will not be effective.**

Exploring how the most used cards are, below you will see the table with the top 100 most used cards so far in the tournaments, and right away we see **Tormod's Crypt**, without cost to play, being able to come in any color to combat decks that use resources from record as Dredge, Reanimate Turno 1 win and even Cycling (used in the latter to disable **Zenith Flare**). It appeared in 67% of the lists and in 65% of the top1 decks, usually 2 to 4 copies. Another good option to deal with the bass that appears in the top 10 is the **Nihil Spellbomb**, for the option to draw for just 1 cost when popping it, there are lists using the main deck. 

[Top 100 cards most used, only tournaments in Season 18, without basic lands.](https://preview.redd.it/7m6vhufxz1w51.png?width=969&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5ad6caf9a714405314e29184665631f4cd36916)

As a great combo blocker, **Deafening Silence** is widely used from 2 to 3 copies on the sides as well as the **Ethersworn Canonist** who most of the time already goes from the main deck. Another factor that removes the deck combos from the domain in the format were the possibilities of removing the pieces still on the deck such as **Cranial Extraction**, **Memoricide**, **Slaughter Games** and **Stain the Mind**. 

Going back to talking about Grave hate, we have some possibilities like **Tymaret, Chosen from Death** and **Cling to Dust** that can play up to the main. Another one that appears most often, **Dryad Militant** is a good option to use on White Winnie decks or that have green as well. Here I take the opportunity to bring the &gt;!second tip:!&lt; **if there are cards that you can use the most volatile form in your main deck strategy, explore this, Cling to Dust for example, it is less of a grave hate side that can go to the main, you can gain 3 life (great against aggros) or in the worst case you buy a card (note: you still have the Escape option).**

Another need for sideboard use this season is cards that break artifacts and / or enchantments. With several Affinitys working, every sideboard carries 2 to 4 hate of artifacts and enchantments, which can be one-off or global depending on your deck strategy. Among the most common and that can be used in more than one option are **Feed the Swarm**, **Return to Nature** and **Fracturing Gust**. In the line of artifact removal, we have: **Smash to Smithereens, Vandalblast, shenanigans,** and being global: **Granulate, Creeping Corrosion, Purify**.

This season we had the possibility to experience a very fast speed in the game, including, as we will see below, the archetype that has won more times and with more decks in the current goal, the Aggros have an Achilles heel that thanks to the gods, we obtained some low cost global removals: In red we have **Pyroclasm** and **Slagstorm**, in White, perhaps the most effective global removal of the format, **Day of Judgment.** In black some good removals are also strong like **Yahenni's Expertise**, **Drown in Sorrow**, **Ritual of Soot** and **Consume the Meek**.

![img](obliovdt22w51 " 
S18 archetypes, counting only tournaments up to 10/29")

As planeswalkers appearing on the side, we have **Dovin, Hand of Control**, **Teyo, the Shieldmage** and **Gideon Jura**, all focused on delaying or protecting until the development of the main strategy. &gt;!Third tip!&lt;: **Do not leave your main strategy to use side, there are decks like Merfolks that do not use serious hate for example because besides the deck being extremely fast, if a reanimate wants to make fun there are cost 1 bounces and cost 1 counters too.** 

And this 3rd tip brings a very interesting question, do not think about how to hinder the opponent, but how you get an advantage while developing your strategy. Examples: In a Burn deck the idea is to use direct damage on the opponent to kill him, if the player puts a lot of creatures you can end up dying faster or creatures with lifelink will also make you have problems, in this case **Satyr Firedancer** is a good choice of side, while you continue to deal direct damage, removing opponent creatures. Still in the red, I've seen decks using **Dragon's Claw** against mirrors because they can come to life by themselves and by the opponent's magic. 

Little explored ideas: Personally I like to test different things and some things that I managed to generate a lot of value and I don't see much used, were **Guerrilla Tactics** in a burn, since one of the options when someone takes the front is to use disposal to remove the resources. **Lightning Rift** on decks that use red when facing cyclings to use the opponent's resources against him. And lastly, my current side against cyclings and even some deck combos: **Uba Mask**, as the card will be exiled, it cannot be cycled. 

Well, in general, I believe that Penny ends up having a hard time creating a unique side, the format is not as static as others, which makes it even fun in my opinion. These are the most used cards, but there are countless others that are available. For this season I always follow this sideboard ratio and adjust for my deck strategy: 

* 3 to 4 cards to deal with Graveyard, removal. 
* 2 removal of artifacts and enchantments.
* 2 to 4 combos break.
* 2 to 3 creature removals and / or boardwipe.
* 3 or 4 life gain. 

Always remembering that there are cards that meet more than one of these options, and always respecting the game line of your deck. As a &gt;!fourth tip!&lt; **what helps me a lot is to do reverse engineering:** I usually get the decks that I have the most difficulty winning and use them in some test matches. Playing with the deck can you see where the callus grips, what are the difficulties, which loss of resource affects the most? This helps me both in choosing when building the side and when starting to choose which cards will come in and which will come out between games. 

To conclude with an aid in adapting the side, accompanied there as it was in the last week, that the decks are giving more work to be fought. 

\--- SUMMARY METAGAME OF THE WEEK ---

With a smaller participation of the players this weekend, we saw a dominance of the colors Izzet, with the Affinity piloted by the player BR ravage.pe that took 3 top1 and Izzet Drakes from Honourbound84 taking 1 top1 and 1 top2 added 4 of the 6 champions of this weekend. Another deck that appeared a lot was also the Reanimate turn 1 win appearing 4 times at the top. But in general the top8 were well sprayed, with few RDWs and Burns, Merfolks piloted by BR Shadowater0 made top1 again just like a UB Storm. Dredge, Mono Blue delver, esper control and Rakdos Aristrocatas appeared twice each:

I would really like to begin working my way into the a chase trifecta and would like to begin with the chase freedom flex due to the 5% revolving categories that I believe fits my wallet. That said, I have been doing some research and found that some people have suggested creating a checking or savings account with chase would help in the application process.

2020-10-29 16:12:03 : My Job is to Guide Others to the Afterlife : bstant7 : https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/jkcyp2/my_job_is_to_guide_others_to_the_afterlife/

 I guess I’ll start by saying hi. I haven’t really communicated with multiple people in a long time so I’m a little unsure how to go about it, but my name’s Dux and as the title suggests I’m what’s called a Reaper. There’s two tiers of reapers, one is the one most of you may be familiar with, the traditional “Grim Reaper”, where a soul dies and the reaper comes in to ferry it to Heaven or Hell and the second one, the one I am, is the lower tier. Essentially I live my life as a human would, but every couple weeks I have to guide a soul who was taken before their time. I’ll explain what this means more in a bit, but basically some are chosen to meet their eternity early. Basically a soul can become a reaper after they die and repent. I myself died right near the turn of the 20th century and have been at this for about a hundred years now. After two hundred I’ll get bumped up to Tier 2 and if you’re confused by my less than traditional name, Reaper’s get to choose their own name after their first ferry and I chose Dux which means Leader. I thought it was fitting, but I digress.

Back to the point. In Tier 1 the souls aren’t dead yet, but they have the choice to face a series of trials to get into Heaven or Hell. The reason I’m writing this post is because of my last ferry. In my hundred years of ferrying I’ve only had about 3 dozen souls, like I said this is a very very rare opportunity for souls, but this one was my youngest and something about it has stuck with me and I needed for someone to read this so that they know what’s possible and maybe if you’re one of the “lucky” chosen then you can be prepared or you at the very least know to turn back.

Abraham had just turned 14. I don’t know why he was chosen so early. If I had it my way this wouldn’t even be an option, but I don’t have a choice. I was placed with Abe, so the calling had to begin. It starts with dreams a few weeks before it’s time. The soul will start hearing their reaper’s voice calling out to them. It’s faint and really not noticeable at first when they’re awake, but it drowns out their dreams for days. Eventually their mind can make sense of the Enochian and that’s when it takes a turn.

As soon as they make the translation the gentle calls of their name turn into sounds of Hell and their dreams are overtaken by what could possibly await them. I always try to yell over the screams a simple mantra, “The path to Darkness is paved with gold, but Paradise lies beyond pain” but I really don’t know if it ever makes it through and the fact that before Abe I only had four people make it to Heaven makes me think it doesn’t.

During this time a reaper starts to, connect, with their soul. Essentially we start to feel what they’re feeling. Pain, Joy, Fear, really whatever they feel I start to feel. This helps us sympathize further and, allegedly, this is supposed to help more souls make it to Heaven, but again 4 have, so I think it’s bullshit. Anyway, this will go on for weeks until the soul is finally ready. By ready I mean they can barely sleep or function in general out of fear from the nightmares they’re experiencing and the voices they’re hearing throughout the day now. I hate that it comes to that, but eventually we can bring them to the path. 

Abe went to sleep that last night with peace. I could feel his bliss as he was finally able to rest his head on his pillow and listen to nothing but silence. As soon as they fall asleep I usually summon them, but I let Abe rest. It broke my heart that I had to bring him and I really wanted him to enjoy the last bit of peace that he ever might experience.

Eventually I relented and brought him to The Path. I stood at the entrance to the path as Abe stood with his back to me. I could instantly feel his fear more intense than ever. I felt fear that I hadn’t ever experienced from a soul. He shivered and shook violently from the freezing cold around us and his panic at standing alone in the pitch black. I looked at my own hands and realized I had started slightly shaking as well which was odd. I looked back at him with curiosity and snapped my fingers. Suddenly the path fully opened and the clearing we were standing in was bathed in light and warmth. I watched his shoulders relax and immediately felt his fear diminish. It wasn’t gone, but it was lessened for the time being. I tried to hold back a smile, but I couldn’t.

As he turned I could feel his joy rise and then the fear was back like never before. This was a normal step. Reapers take on the form of whatever soul they’re in charge of at the time, again this is supposed to make the transition easier or something, but I know when I saw my reaper it was the most terrifying moment of my life or afterlife. I kept the smile on my face to try and project a feeling of calm to the boy, but the connection’s only one way.

I beckoned for him to join me, but he didn’t move. Understandable. The fear I was feeling through Abe made my smile waver, but I fought through it as he started floated towards me. This is something we have to do sometimes and if any of you ever experience this it’s nothing to be ashamed of. This is a scary moment and sometimes your legs just don’t want to work. The way he kept eye contact with me while he floated was new though and a little off putting. I could feel that even with his fear he was a strong kid and was trying to maintain that on the outside, ready for anything I was about to throw at him. It gave me fleeting confidence in that moment. He had no idea what was waiting.

When Abe was about 3 feet from me he was lowered back to the ground. I gave him a second to run through the gambit of emotions that were normal for the situation and felt each one with him. He pushed right through disbelief and horror and settled almost immediately on dread. Again my smile fell momentarily as I shook from the strength of what he was feeling. I shook it off and cleared my throat, ““Hello Abraham. My name is Dux. I have the honor of being your guide on the final path. You may ask me anything you like.”

Abraham didn’t move. I could feel the tears coming before I saw them, “F...final path?” He stammered. I nodded slowly. “I’m only 14.”

I tried to maintain a cheery look, but had to blink my eyes to maintain composure. “Yes, you haven’t lived a long life, but some are given early release from the mortal plane to gain the chance to live forever in Paradise. Congratulations.” I know it sounds so stupid and cliche, but we basically have a script. As expected, Abe stood in silence so I cleared my throat again and continued, “I’m what’s called a reaper. I was once human and I wasn’t given this same opportunity so you truly are getting something special.” With that I could actually manage a real smile. Abe’s spirits lifted for a second when he heard he was special and that lifted the weight sitting on me for a moment.

That moment crumbled as Abe fell to his knees in tears. “But I don’t want to go. I’m only 14.” I reached a shaking hand out to touch his shoulder, but Abe pulled away, “I don’t want to go.”

I couldn’t figure out what was wrong with me. Most of my souls are middle aged or older and I can suppress their feelings easily. The one time I needed to maintain composure to calm this child and I couldn’t.

I took my time to collect myself. “I understand. Again I wasn’t given this opportunity I just died young and became a reaper to save myself from the darkness. This is a way for you to avoid the darkness.”

Abe sniffed and tried to compose himself. “If I have to do this, what do I have to do.” I could feel that strength bubble to the surface again. His confidence was at war with his fear and an involuntary smile spread across my face.

“It’s not going to be easy,” I began, “but you’ll endure a series of tests and depending on how you face them you will be placed in Paradise or be thrown to the darkness. After each test you can continue or leave the choice is yours.”

Abe took a couple breaths before responding, “What kind of tests?”

I sighed, “They get progressively worse. I can’t say exactly what they are, but it’s not going to be easy. Like I said, there is an exit after every one.”

I let the words hang in the air and felt him go through emotions so quickly I could barely feel them before the next one was there. “That being said. You can end this right now and go back to your life.” Abe looked up at me with curiosity and confusion. “You pass these trials and you make it to Heaven. If you don’t….you don’t. Or you can take your chance with life and hope everything works out in your favor.”

This new information sent his mind into overdrive. For a young kid he weighed the pros and cons with a level of maturity that most older souls don’t even have. He stood there in external silence for a while. I went to say something else, but he interrupted me, “Let’s fucking go.” He said it with such force that I couldn’t help but smile. This kid was infectious and I think I knew why he was chosen for this. I reached out my hand and after some hesitation led him through the trees behind me.

We walked in silence and I felt him trying to get a hold of his nerves, “What’s the first test?” He finally asked.  

“The first one is relatively easy.” I said while keeping my eyes straight ahead. “This is also the only one I can help you on. Do not look at anyone in this test. If you have to close your eyes, close them, I don’t care, just don’t look anyone in the eyes.”

Abe gulped, almost regretting asking the question, and continued in silence until we came upon a split in the path. “We’ve reached our first decision. Would you like to forgo the tests.” I said gesturing to the left path that had a bright golden glow to it, “Or would you like to endure.” I finished, waving my hand towards the right path that was shrouded in darkness. Faint moans could be heard through the black. Again don’t get on me about the cheese, it’s stuff I have to say.

“Let’s test it.” Abe said after a breath. I smiled, hoping desperately that he could feel me trying to be reassuring. The left path dimmed and we continued to the right. 

I left Abe in the darkness and moved to the end of the trial. I could see and feel everything he endured during each trial and I shook with his nervousness. “Good luck,” I yelled to him as the darkness lifted around him. 

Abe’s head immediately shot towards the sky and at first I could feel confidence start to take over. But then the test actually began. As soon as he took a step the air around him erupted into pained moans. I watched as the figures that I knew to be damned souls swarmed around him aimlessly. They weren’t going to do anything, unless he looked at them, hence my warning. He froze immediately and I could feel the fear start to grab hold. I silently cheered him on and eventually he took a deep breath and started moving again. It took all I had to not start cheering for the kid. I saw him bump off a few of the souls and stop each time consumed by fear. 

“Close your eyes.” I accidentally said out loud. I looked around quickly and then realized I’m always alone during these trials so are there even rules? I wasn’t even sure he heard me until he stopped a final time and closed his eyes. He brought his head down to face forward and I could feel his immediate relief as looking up was beginning to strain his neck. I took a deep breath and started feeling a bit better myself. He shook slightly as the moans grew louder as more souls filtered in from the trees and aimlessly wandered around him. He gulped and put out his hands and began on his way again.

He made his way through at a painfully slow pace, but as long as he made it through the timing didn’t matter. He eventually made it past the mass of bodies and I could feel his fear start to dissolve as the moans most likely were starting to die away the further he went. When he was about 100 yards from the end of the path he stopped. I didn’t know what was going on, but all of a sudden his eyes shot open. My heart dropped as he stared in my direction in confusion. He can’t see me or anything beyond this trial until it’s complete so when he opened his eyes all he saw was darkness at the end. 

I could feel his confusion turn to panic as he started frantically looking around, thankfully just side to side at first, but then to my horror he turned around. He grew completely still and couldn’t even shake from terror when he saw the grotesque, human-ish figures that he had just passed through bumping into each other and slowly moving back and forth. I don’t blame the kid as the naked wrinkly skinned creatures still give me the creeps after all this time. I held my breath and was frozen from his fear as one of the souls met Abe’s eyes.

The moaning stopped and the hoard turned in his direction in unison. Time seemed to freeze as everyone stood motionless. As soon as Abe took a step back the hoard let out horrifying screams and began to stream towards him at an unbelievable pace. To his credit, Abe didn’t let his crippling fear slow him down as he turned and sprinted in my direction with everything he had. I could feel his desperation and looked from him to the hoard that was rapidly gaining ground and back again. I could hear his panting and realized I was panting myself as I started screaming for him to hurry. Fuck the rules. 

The leading souls reached out and barely grazed his shirt as he got about 25 yards from me. I was all but reaching out my hand at this point. A chill went through my body as one of the souls dove and grabbed him around the ankle throwing him forward. His top half of his torso landed out of the trial and he looked up at me with panic, pleading with his eyes even though he was too afraid to speak. I hesitated for a split second too long and the hoard began dragging the child back into the trial. He kicked violently and let out a heart wrenching scream as the skin was starting to get torn from his calves. That was enough for me to reach down and drag the kid the rest of the way. 

As soon as his feet crossed the border everything behind us turned to black and we were left there with him sobbing softly on the ground and me, panting, standing over him. I could feel his pain and it crushed me. No kid should have to go through this. His sobbing slowly faded and I could feel relief start to overtake the desperation and fear he was feeling. 

I knelt down beside him and put my hands on his back. I was able to catch my breath, “I told you not to look at them.” I tried to say something light, but I’m not sure if that was the right thing as he shot around and stared at me.

He didn’t say anything but I knew he was angry. I sighed and helped him to his feet.

“Can I rest for a moment please?” He pleaded with me. 

“I’m sorry, but no. We have a while to go before the next trial and I promise you’ll be feeling better by then.” I was lying and I knew he knew it. He didn’t bother looking at me for a while or saying anything. I didn’t blame him and my own shame started to fight with his pain in my head.

We were almost near the second trial when he finally asked, “What the hell was that?”

I looked at him, but didn’t break stride, “That was the first test. Those were lost souls who refused to repent, but didn’t deserve the darkness. Basically they rot and turn into that. It’s like limbo I guess.” 

“Would that be me if they dragged me back?”

“No that would have been much worse.” I replied shortly. The less I talked it seemed to help me control his emotions that I was feeling so. 

I could feel fear suddenly spike in him and glanced over to see him looking towards the trees that lined the path around us. I knew he was looking at the dark silhouettes that stood in between the trees, but he didn’t ask and again I was trying not to speak as much, so we just kept walking. 

I stopped when we reached another fork in the path. “We have reached our second choice. Would you like to exit, or continue?” I asked, gesturing to both paths respectively. 

Abe didn’t hesitate, “Test.” I smiled proudly. The left path again was thrust into darkness  and Abe moved towards the right.

“Good luck Abraham.” I said before Abe walked into the darkness.

I took my spot at the end of the trial and watched nervously as the darkness lifted around Abe and he was immediately hit with a strong gust of wind forcing him to stagger and brace himself. I felt his fear for a split second, but he quickly regained his confidence as he was able to find his footing and slowly trek forward. Stumbling, I could feel his pain start to lift as the cold air and freezing winds numbed his raw legs.

The further along the path he trudged, the stronger the winds became and eventually he had to lean forward to brace himself. I could feel stabbing pain starting to creep back as the cooling effects of the wind started going in the opposite direction on the rest of his body, stinging his skin and eyes. This is one of the shortest trials, but probably takes the longest and the fact that after about half an hour he was only about 10 feet along was a great testament to that.

Eventually, as they all do, Abe leaned about as far forward as he could and stopped moving. I shook slightly from the cold that he was feeling on his own body, a sensation I hadn’t felt since my own penance. I attempted, pretty unsuccessfully to control my slight shiver. While I was focusing on myself, Abe laid down and started crawling with his eyes closed along the ground. I could feel his agony every time he dug his fingers into the almost frozen dirt. He was going a lot slower than standing, but he was moving at a more consistent pace than before. I felt a quick twinge of fear, but I think he was way too cold to feel or think anything. The winds continued to get stronger until he was about 10 feet away from me and I could see him start to slide backwards along the ground. He furiously flailed his hands in front of him and dug even deeper into the hard ground then before. 

He let out a scream of pain as I could see his fingernails start to lift off of his bloody hands. The progress was much slower and more excruciating, but inch by inch he came to the end. He let out one last defiant roar that sent shivers down my spine and pulled himself the last bit until the path grew dark and he laid on his back at my feet, shivering uncontrollably with his eyes closed. I knelt down next to him and could hear the faintest sobs as a tear forced its way out of his eyelid. My own eyes started to bubble slightly, but I rubbed then and put a hand on his shoulder.

“You’re doing amazing kid.” I tried to sound as reassuring and confident as possible, but my voice wavered a bit as his fear and pain overtook me. Abe opened his eyes and stared blankly at the black starless sky that hung above us. If you didn’t know any better you’d think we were in a bottomless pit with no hope of clawing our way to the surface and I could tell by his stone face still spanked with tears that he was feeling that emptiness and hopelessness.

He didn’t say anything for a long time and I let him sit with this. As his body thawed the pain returned to his legs and hands, but to the kid’s credit he didn’t show it. I could feel his internal agony, but his face was stoic. I looked at the blood streaming from his legs and noticed he was missing a few nails and could do nothing, but sigh. I wanted to pick the kid up and carry him, I wanted to help him along, but he needed to be strong to make it through and that wouldn’t help. 

After some time he looked at me and allowed me to help him to his feet. We moved along much slower than before in silence that was suddenly broken by screaming all around us. Abe surged with fear and looked around as a cold sweat started pouring down his face. “What is that?” he asked almost inaudibly, looking at the many more figures that were now standing in the trees.

I was too transfixed by Abe’s pain to remember the figures at first, but then I snapped out of it. I looked side to side without stopping our progress, “Those are souls that were lost to this particular test. They have to stay here for eternity and watch others try to succeed where they failed. That’s what would’ve happened if those creatures on test one had pulled you back or if you couldn’t make it past the winds. 

The screams were faint right now, but I knew it would get worse as we moved further in the tests. He was shaking in fear looking around us and was too preoccupied to realize we had gotten to the next fork. I didn’t even bother going through my whole thing this time and just nodded to him. 

Abe exhaled sharply. “Test.” he breathed out.

I gave his shoulder a squeeze. “You can make it through this Abraham.” I pulled the kid in and kissed the top of his head. “Good luck.”

As soon as the darkness lifted ice hit Abe’s head without warning. A tremendous hail was pouring down on him from above. He didn’t hesitate this time. As soon the cold from this test numbed his raw legs and nailless fingers and he used that to his advantage. I watched with a tentative smile as Abe waited for the cold to take it’s hold and began to sprint as fast as he could. The hail grew worse as he moved until I knew there was just a wall of white pain in front of him, but he never broke stride and closed his eyes.

The more he ran the more confidence I could feel surge in him, but I couldn’t share the feeling and as soon as a terrible roar cut through the almost deafening sound of hail that confidence was shattered and he stopped in his tracks. His eyes shot open and then back to a squint as he frantically looked around trying to identify the source of the sound, eventually landing on the giant 3-headed creature perched on a throne overlooking the trial. I knew Cerberus wasn’t a threat, but I was hoping he didn’t shake Abe long enough to impede his progress on this trial.

To my relief Abe slowly continued on again without taking his eyes off the motionless figure. His senses were heightened now and the pain from the hail was starting to make it’s way to the surface. Without warning Abe turned back towards me, closed his eyes and sprinted faster than ever. One last roar tore through the air and chased him out, but the path grew dark and Abe stood in front of me, hunched over and panting.

I could feel the stinging on his skin and couldn’t tell if his slight shiver was from the cold or pain, but I put my hand on his back. “That was fast man.” I said with a sense of pride taking over. “Honestly one of the fastest I’ve seen in my time.”

He looked up at me, still trying to catch his breath and wordlessly just gestured for us to move on. This is one of the first times in years I felt genuine joy. This kid was strong. I held him back for a second and looked him in the eyes. “It may not seem like it, but you’re doing really good right now.” I looked for confirmation in his eyes or anything, but I could feel his lack of confidence and it hurt. I bit my lip and sighed. We both looked down and saw the massive collection of welts that joined his torn legs and hands. He started trembling and tearing up as he watched the blood pour down his shins and over his destroyed shoes. I could feel his regret and my stomach began to hurt.

I put my arm around his shoulders and began leading him down the path. I went to say something hopefully reassuring, but he interrupted me, “What the hell is a reaper anyway?”

I was a little taken aback by the question. Not that I don’t get asked, because I do, but I usually get asked much much earlier in the process. “Well the short version is we ferry souls.” He cringed a bit as the screaming began around us. I wasn’t going to continue, but I knew the kid needed a distraction for a second. “When we die some of us are given this option as penance for our sins. We spend a few hundred or thousand years ferrying souls depending on our sins and then go to Heaven.”

He didn’t react to anything I was saying and I knew he didn’t care. I wasn’t feeling anything from him which was new. I think he was trying to numb himself. Smart.

We came up to the next fork and before I even attempted to speak he yelled, “Right!”

I sighed and nodded slowly. I didn’t bother with the good lucks this time and he didn’t look at me, just walked into the darkness.

The darkness lifted and Abe looked curiously at the large boulder that stood in front of him. He was still numbing himself but I could feel curiosity start to peak through. I smirked at the fact that he wasn’t afraid. Even when he saw the tiny goblin like creatures standing around the boulder excitedly jumping around and screeching to themselves the stupid language they speak, he was just curious and nothing else. I saw him flinch in pain as his injuries began to take their toll again. He closed his eyes and hung his head, clenching his fists trying to control himself. 

As he looked down the goblins hopped over and dragged him towards the boulder. They strapped a chain around his waist and excitedly laughed and jumped their way back into the trees. His eyes were still closed and he didn’t move for a while. I was growing more nervous as I felt the pain radiate worse than ever before. 

I gave him a few more minutes, trying to suppress the pain that now surged throughout my body. “Fucking go kid!” I managed to scream.

This seemed to break his trance and his eyes shot open, looking in my direction a few hundred yards away. He stumbled forward until the rope was taut and stopped. He turned towards the boulder and took a few deep breaths, grabbing the chain with both hands. He yanked as hard as he could and the boulder moved a couple inches. “Fuck.” I could hear him mutter, resigned.

This trial wasn’t that hard, but it was grueling. Honestly after this one a lot gave up, if they even made it this far and this is what I feared for Abe. I held my breath, silently cheering for him. Out of nowhere I felt a wave of confidence over take him as he took his time moving the massive stone. I knew he still felt the pain all over his body, but slowly, very slowly he inched forward. He stopped when the pain was too much, but after maybe 10 yards or so his body began to numb and he could continue on. With the pain gone in his legs he could drive forward with more power and moved a bit faster, but after about half a day of pulling I could feel his confidence wavering.

To my disappointment he first sat and then laid down, basically giving up. I was heartbroken. I hung my head and just waited for him inevitably to just pass on. I sat staring at him not knowing what to do besides playing with the dirt in front of me. We sat like that for 20 minutes or so when out of nowhere he sprung to his feet and I could feel fear surge through him. I didn’t know what had prompted this but I was all for it. I jumped up as well and started yelling for him.

He turned his back to me again and pulled and didn’t stop pulling this time. I could feel the strain and watched him dig his heels into the ground and pull with everything he had. He let out a few screams and inched his way towards me. His confidence overtook the fear as he moved closer and closer until after a full day was almost at the end of the trial. I reached across the barrier and my hand started burning painfully. I pulled back surprised. I never tried to help a soul before.

I hesitated and swallowed as his progress had slowed. I took a deep breath and jumped onto the path. The searing pain forced me to let out a scream that startled Abe, who turned to me and jumped back. I screamed again and grabbed his chain. I saw smoke coming from my arms as we both pulled the last few feet and felt immediate relief when we made it to the other side.

This time we both slumped over and panted. I caught my breathe first and my body had already started healing so the burns that had formed on my arms were closing themselves. I let out a little laugh, “I’m not doing that again.” I said with a smile and looked up at him, but he wasn’t looking back.

He looked worse than before and now on top of the crippling pain, I could feel his utter exhaustion. I limped over to him and put a hand on his shoulder. He wasn’t crying, but I knew he wanted to. “If you want to stop, I can carry you.” I bent down and whispered in his ear.

He took a couple more seconds and a sinking feeling began forming in my gut. I wanted him to refuse, but I’ve seen this look before, when a soul is done, they’re done. The longer he took to answer or even look at me the worse I felt. With him responding I went to lift him, but he slapped me away. “I’m not done yet.” He said looking at me with fire and determination that I wasn’t expecting. Another shiver went down my spine and I beamed with pride. 

I grabbed his hand and helped him get fully upright. “You got this kid.” I said pulling him in for an embrace.

His words and eyes gave off confidence and defiance, but I could feel his resignation and fear. I held him for a long time trying my best to let him heal as best I could. We pulled away and began on our way. The screams were louder now than ever and it was pointless to even try talking. It was better at this stage to conserve energy anyway and soon we were to the next fork. 

I didn’t ask or gesture. I didn’t need a response because I knew our journey together was going to continue. Faint splashing could be heard from the dark right path and I saw him hesitantly look at the shining gold path to the left. He took a couple deep breaths and moved to the right, into the darkness.

I took my normal place at the end of the trial and was pleased to see my friend Nuntius standing there waiting for me. “Dux!” he yelled when he saw me and we embraced. “It’s been too long, I’m sorry that we’re meeting again though.”

I sighed and told him I shared his sentiments. When the pleasantries were finished we stared at each other in silent pity for a few moments. “How is yours.” I finally asked.

He sighed, “He’s a good guy of course, they all are. But he doesn’t have the strength, I know,” He let out a deep, sad sigh, “this is his last trial.” 

I clapped a hand on my friend’s shoulder, “I’m so sorry. Thankfully this is your last ferry?”

I saw his lips quiver trying to smile, but it wouldn’t come. “I would’ve liked to end it by bringing another soul to paradise, but take it from an old veteran, watching good people suffer is still part of the penance.”

We touched foreheads and stayed silent for a few moments with our eyes closed before I whispered. “My kid is strong.”

Our eyes opened and I continued, “He’s one of the strongest I’ve had, he’s young, but worthy.” Nuntius weakly smiled and gave me a knowing nod. “I’m truly sorry for this.” 

We put our arms around each other and looked at the trial.

Abe stood on one side of a narrow, decrepit, wooden path sitting about 35 feet above a raging river. On the opposite side of the path stood a man of about 50 who looked to be in worse shape than my Abraham. I looked at Nun and he nodded reluctantly. We turned back and the man looked horrified while I could see and feel Abe’s curiosity as he looked at the tall black waves that almost reached his pier, flinching ever so slightly everytime a skinny, decayed hand reached out looking for anyone to raise them from their fate.

Abe eventually looked back to the man who was still shaking and looking around in fear. Abe did nothing as the man finally looked to him and they both stood there in confusion, neither knowing what to do. Out of seemingly nowhere during their stare there was a large crack of lightning and in each of their hands an old rusty sword and old wooden shield appeared. I felt Nun tense up in my grasp as the two froze in place as a sense of shock overtook Abe and I knew he knew what was going on. 

Nervously he looked up to the man, who was staring at the sword and shield with a mixture of fear and shock. I held my breath as Abe looked from the sword to the man and back and then slowly made his way to the other side of the walkway. The man looked up and saw Abe approaching and lifted his sword, but didn’t move. Abe picked up speed as he ran forward and let out a scream before swinging down so violently that both Nuntius and I jumped back. The man blocked with his shield but was thrown back to the edge of the walkway.

Abe didn’t let up and dropped his shield to use both hands to swing down over and over and over onto the man’s shield. I could see tears filling his eyes and could feel how afraid he was in this moment. The man kicked him in the gut sending the small child flying back and they once again stood staring at each other as the waves below grew higher and higher, starting to soak the moldy, broken boards upon which the two souls sparred. They both let out screams and ran towards each other, swords cocked back ready to strike. Neither were very skilled and simply swung at each other trying desperately to hit something fleshy. 

Abe landed the first blow, stabbing the man in the gut. He let out a small cry of pain, but didn’t let up on the much smaller soul. Swinging overhead relentlessly eventually getting Abe with a good jab to the shoulder. The child screamed and dropped his sword off the edge of the platform into the dark water below as a thick stream of blood started pouring out of him. I winced and closed my eyes and only opened them when I felt my friend’s hand squeeze my shoulder. 

Through watery eyes I watched in terror as the kid fell to his back and started crawling backwards away from the man. I fell to my knees as the tears ran down his face and could barely make out his pleas of mercy over the raging waves. Nun knelt down next to me and embraced me hard. We both knew how hard this was and I know he was not enjoying my misery.

Abe scrambled backwards as quickly as he could as the man slowly followed him and raised his sword above his head,  bringing it down hard onto Abe’s blocking arm, making a clean cut and sending the severed limb tumbling over the edge. Abe and I both let out heart wrenching screams as I completely fell to the ground and he stopped scrambling, holding his severed appendage. The man had tears running down his face and I felt Nuntius lean in close to my ear. “He’s sorry.” 

Abe was rolling in pain as the blood soaked the platform around him. The man hesitated, he was a good man after all, but then raised his sword for one final swipe. As he brought the blade down the waves finally reached the platform and one of the lost souls in the water found what it was looking for as a decaying hand grabbed the man’s ankle and dragged him, screaming in terror into the waters below.

Nuntius and I both sat there, stunned. We had never seen a soul be grabbed. We knew what swam in the Styx, but had never seen them grab another soul. I could still barely stand as Abe now lay writhing in pain, still clutching his severed arm on solid ground. Nuntius let out a breath and looked from Abe and back to me. 

He didn’t say anything and he didn’t have too. I nodded my head as my eyes began to tear. He stood up and began to walk away, “I hope to see you in the next phase my friend.” I called weakly after him.

He turned and smiled to me, nodding before disappearing into the trees.

I weakly crawled over to Abe who was crying silently on the ground as his arm bled. I didn’t say anything at first and laid next to him, not able to take his pain, but just feel it. I wanted to take it. I wanted to take him back and make him go back to his life. It was too late.

I managed to get to my feet and he still didn’t open his eyes or move. All he did was whisper, “Please carry me.” Through tears.

I let out an exasperated sigh and nodded, trying to catch my breath before I reached down and scooped up his body. His blood poured down on me as we trudged along slowly and the screaming souls were silent. I felt tears form in my eyes and for the first time since my own penance they dripped down my face onto the motionless figure that I carried. 

I was shaking as we finally got to the fork for the 6th trial. I went to speak but was stopped by the sobs that I thought were from Abe but realized were coming from me. I began again as my tears soaked my face. “I don’t care that I carried you. You can continue.” I looked down at the young face all but pleading with him to continue onto the Light.  

He looked at me and, coughing up blood, smiled, “No more tests Dux.” I fell to my knees and dropped him to the ground. I sobbed uncontrollably as he struggled to his feet and turned to hug me, “Thank you.”

“I...I’m so sorry Abraham.” was all I could muster as I watched the child slowly walk towards the golden path to the left. 

“The path to Darkness is paved with gold, but Paradise lies beyond pain.” I heard him lightly chant to himself as he moved.

I smiled slightly as he crossed the barrier and I watched and felt as his severed arm grew back and felt all his pain vanish as joy filled his heart. He paused just beyond the barrier and I could feel a surge of fear overtake him. I couldn’t see what he was seeing but he turned back screaming and ran towards me before the darkness consumed him and he was gone.

I… I don’t have a choice, but to continue with the path that I’ve chosen. I don’t have a choice but to try and be a better ferryman to those who decide to take this path. But please, please  if you are given the chance, turn back and live your life, take your chances.

2020-10-29 16:12:18 : What are considered non fast paced jobs that are professional? : Madeline2853 : https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/jkcyv8/what_are_considered_non_fast_paced_jobs_that_are/

People suggest, "just apply here, there's a help wanted sign."

Why dont people ever engage in a discussion about the math.

The net income, and how that covers a budget to live on.

I need a certain income to meet my expenses, including housing, car and healthcare.

But I've had people say, "don't worry about what it pays, some money is better than no money."

What if you cant work a 2nd job, but can work 7am to 5pm.

But the job pays $12.00 hour pretax

I was told I have to disregard my finance and masters degrees and that some money is better than no money,  even if it doesnt qualify me for housing and would only cover my car, past due bills, phone, food and medications but not housing.

I want to focus on the math.

$12.00 is $10.00 net

$10/hour = $400 week or $1,600

Healthcare $200/month
Car $300/month plus $100 insurance
$200 gas

$400 food, miscellaneous, hygiene products, laundry, car maintenance 

$65 phone

Need money for:
Housing $
Grad loan which has to be paid $
Medical and dental copayments $
Clothing replacement if necessary $
Credit card balance $125 min month pmt

How much do you need to live on to cover those expenses above?

People say "any job is better than no job."

Okay, how do I meet the above expenses, and still be cheerful and chipper in my work, working calmly and composed, under pressure without showing signs of anxiety or stress.

2020-10-29 16:12:18 : Recommend Me - First New Knife : wtellis2 : https://www.reddit.com/r/chefknives/comments/jkcyv3/recommend_me_first_new_knife/

 Hello all!  After spending a couple of hours delving through this subreddit, I figured it was time to get a recommendation.  I have been using hand-me-down knives for most of my "adult" life (at 26, I still find that term debatable at best), and even though I have taken relatively good care of them, I am on the hunt for a more reliable chef's knife.  I have settled on a western/German knife largely due to a need for the more versatile of the two styles, but also won't be using it as a cleaver (will be using an older knife and/or a pair of kitchen shears for tasks like spatchcocking a chicken).  I am not in any rush on this, but would like to take advantage of some of the deals that theoretically will be appearing for Black Friday, so any recommendations from the larger community would be greatly appreciated!

1. Style? - Western.  I know that this subreddit really advocates for a Japanese knife, and I think that is something that will be added to the collection/repertoire down the line, but for what I want out of a knife, it feels like the western/German style will be much better as a workhorse.
2. Steel?  - Stainless.  
3. Handle? - Probably western, but am more open to the alternative here.
4. Grip? - Pinch.  Developed a bad habit of using the handle grip on cheaper knives in the past, trying to grow out of that.  
5. Length? - 210 mm; but could be talked into something longer.
6. Uses? - Everyday usage.  Looking for a workhorse.
7. Care? - Any of the three.  There is a local paid service in town that does exceptional work and offers a great rate.  Have used him in the past, but will eventually transition into doing the honing work myself.  
8. Budget? Somewhere in the $100-$150 range, wouldn't object to something a bit higher but would like to stay away from the $200+ range for now.

Hi.

I've ran into trouble as I've seen a youtuber relate his weekly planner OKR-property  
to a "All OKRs" database/table which I understand, its a One-to-One relationship.

What I can't figure out is how to combine my OKR's (different tables/databases) into  
that one "All OKRs" reference I need to use all OKRs in my scheduling/planning.

Many thanks to the ones who can resolve my confusion.  
Talk to me in a technical manner if possible, I'm a programmer and Ive had  
some SQL as well so I know Im looking for the equivalent of a JOIN or wrapper obj.

2020-11-15 06:40:32 : A Doctor's Guide to Private Health Insurance : howfastfire : https://www.reddit.com/r/fiaustralia/comments/juhmuy/a_doctors_guide_to_private_health_insurance/

I recently posted on here about Salary Packaging and there was qutie a bit of interest around my planned post about Private Health Insurance, so I figured I would expedite it!

Here is an overview of PHI from the PoV of someone working in healthcare that has seen how care pans out for both those with and without PHI. I'm happy to answer any questions, but probably will hold off on answering anything about specific situations etc!

The post is on my blog (link at the end), but I have put it in text form on here for everyone.

*** 
**What is Private Health Insurance?**

Put simply, Private Health Insurance (PHI) is insurance that kicks in when you need in-patient hospital care. In theory, by paying for this you get access to care in a private hospital for no additional cost (more on why this is “in theory”). However, it is significantly more complicated than that. I’ll give a basic overview here, but will not go into specific policies / companies.
***


**What does PHI actually impact if I need an operation?**

This is best understood by working through a theoretical scenario.  



Let’s consider Bob, he is a 65yo man that has been experiencing worsening left knee pain over the past few years. He has had enough and decides to see his GP. The GP does the neccessary workup and diagnoses Bob with osteoarthritis of that knee (essentially a breakdown of the joint, typically an unfortunate consequence of aging that results in pain). He is given some exercises to perform, visits a Physiotherapist and starts taking pain medication. Unfortunately 3 months later the pain is still there. He revisits his GP and the decision is made to refer him to an Orthopedic Surgeon to see if surgery (a knee replacement) would be of value.  
  

Up until this point whether Bob had PHI is irrelevant. His care would have not been delivered faster or in a more comfortable manner, nor would it have been cheaper (with the exception of the Physiotherapist appointment that would potentially be subsidised by his insurer).

Lets assume he does not have PHI and is thus required to go the public route. He can either be referred to the public hospital clinic or to a private surgeons’s rooms. The benefit of public clinic would typically be that it’s free (like attending a bulk-billing GP), but it comes with the negative of having an often long waiting time to get into the clinic. The waiting time is the big issue here, it is HIGHLY variable and could be 1 month or 2 years! This comes to the first question I would advise you to consider when deciding if PHI is for you:
***
**If you developed a condition that decreased your quality-of-life (due to pain etc.) but was not life-threatening what annual value do you place on the impact?**
***
The case of osteoarthritis of the knee is a very good example for this. Bob is in pain, and thus it decreases his quality-of-life. He may not be able to walk long distances and do the things he previously did due to the pain. But, this condition will not kill him, and thus in the eyes of the public healthcare system it is appropriate for him to wait quite a long time. It could get to the point where he cannot walk, and in that case it would become urgent. But I have seen patients wait 1-2 years to see a surgeon (just for the appointment!) in situations like Bob.

Back to the clinic.

Another negative many will mention about the public clinic is that you’ll see different doctor each time you attend, and this doctor will be in training (not a fully training surgeon). The negative impact of this is debatable. Training doctors may not have all the answers, but they will get you one that will be made by either their boss (the person you would have seen in the private clinic), or a training doctor that has almost finished their training.

Let’s say Bob attends the public clinic and the doctors agree he needs a knee replacement. This is where we get to another cross-road. Does he go public or private? An operation done in the public system will be done in a public hospital by a fully-trained surgeon with assistants that are training doctors. You’ll be provided an exceptional standard of care (my personal opinion is that the care you receive once you are admitted to hospital is superior in a public hospital compared to a private hospital) during this admission and at the follow-up appointments (you won’t be waiting months/years for these – it’ll be 1-2 weeks after discharge regardless of if you go private or public). The BIG negative here is again the waiting list. It could be months or years.

So overall if you go to public clinics and have public operations you’ll get an exception standard of care, but you will be waiting. The amount of waiting depends on where you live and what you need done.

Bob in theory could chose to have a private operation (without PHI). But he will have to pay this himself. I would strongly advise against this as you won’t just pay for the fee quoted, but if things go wrong and you have a prolonged stay you’ll pay for that as well (we are talking $1,000s for this).

Let’s now rewind to the referral to the surgeon and imagine Bob still doesn’t have PHI but this time decides to see the surgeon in their private rooms. He will have to pay an out-of-pocket fee for this. The amount will depend on the surgeon, but essentially they set a fee and you pay the difference (typically $100-200 / visit) between this and the amount Medicare will pay. Benefits of this approach is you get in quickly and you get see the fully-trained surgeon. Negatives are you have to pay! Whether you have PHI doesn’t impact this step! PHI will not pay the out-of-pocket fees for outpatient appointments. The surgeon will ask the same question about the operation being done publicly or privately (refer to previous few paragraphs about this).

Overall Bob’s care up until the referral to the surgeon wasn’t impacted by PHI (except paying for physiotherapy appointments). Whether he had a public or private clinic appointment also wasn’t impacted. The fact he had no PHI meant he had to have an operation done publicly. He received an excellent standard of care, but did have to wait a while for this.

But what if he did have PHI?

He would have been referred to the surgeon (most people with PHI will pay for the private surgeon clinic appointment from experience) and could have said yes to the operation being done privately.

Typically, he would be booked onto a list at the private hospital. The operation would be done by the surgeon that he met in the clinic and all after care (care in hospital and after discharge) would be provided by them. I think there are very few situations in which this care is superior to the care in the public system. However, the waiting times will be significantly less (typically) and the private hospital will typically be “nicer” (quieter, single room and better food!).

You can be a private patient in a public hospital still. This means you get the benefits of the public hospital (lots of doctors around 24/7 if anything goes wrong – this far outweights the private benefits of good food etc.) and the benefits of the private care (you have the surgeon you met in clinic). Whether this is an option will depend on the waiting list situation at that hospital (private patients can’t just jump the list).

In terms of the amount you pay for this admission to the private hospital the “hosptial” costs are covered in most instances (ie: you don’t pay a fee for being there). But the surgeon / anaesthetist fee may not be completely covered. This is because the surgeon might charge $5,000 for the operation but the PHI company will only pay $3,000 (so you pay the gap!). There are some very well known surgeons out there that charge extremely high fees and having PHI really won’t make much of a difference here. Please remember for healthcare in Australia more money DOES NOT equal better care! For more details on what your insurer will pay the surgeon you really need to speak to them.
***
**In what cases does it not matter if I have PHI?**
***
If you NEED medical care it won’t matter. Please remember though this isn’t when you think you need it, but when the Australian healthcare system thinks you do. Things like broken bones, cancer and heart attacks will be treated just as quickly in the private system as the public system. People may tell you anecdotes of when someone they knew with one of these conditions had inferior care to someone with PHI. I’d advise you to take this information with a grain of salt. The public healthcare system is very efficient at providing care to those that need it most in a timely fashion.
***
**What benefits beyond access to private hospital care does PHI give me?**
***
LOTS! This is something that varies between insurers and by the level of cover you have. Things like paying for the first $X of dental care per year is a common one. I would advise you to look at what amount of $ you spend on healthcare annually then when you look at a policy determine how much of this the PHI would cover. This helps you work out the cost-effectiveness of the insurance. This brings me to next question you need to ask yourself when considering PHI.
***
**How much do I spend annually on health care (dental/physio etc) and how much of this would PHI cover?**
***

For those of you that are interested this is where you can look at the quantitative benefits of PHI (ie: it’ll only cost me $X annually when I consider extras like paying for dental). Everything up to this point has been qualitative benefits (ie: I’ll wait less time for an operation).
***
**Other Savings**
***
The simplest saving PHI can provide you is not having to pay the Medicare levy surcharge. The ATO provides a great explanation of how much you’d save if you have PHI. For a single person earning $90,000 they’ll pay 1% of their income – $900. For someone earning $140k they’ll pay 1.5% – $2,000. If you are a high income earner without PHI I would strongly suggest looking into it. You may actaully save money by getting PHI.

The next thing to look at is Lifetime health cover. This is a government initative to make it cheaper to get PHI early in life. Put simply if you are 31 and DO NOT have PHI you pay a 2% fee on top of any premiums (if you do get it after 31) for each year you are over 31. For example if you are 40 years old you’ll pay 2% x 10 years (20%) extra on premiums. This keeps going until you get to 70% but only has to be paid for 10 years of premiums.

Both of these iniatives give reasons for young people to get PHI. This takes the strain of the public system and saves the government $$$.

This comes to the third question:
***
**Are there any government incentives that would save me money if I got PHI now?**
***

You’ll find if you either make lots of money or are young and intend to get PHI in the future getting it ASAP may be a big money saver.
***
**Am I covered for existing conditions?**
***

This is something you’ll need to talk to the insurer about. But typically if you didn’t have the condition when you signed up for the PHI they will cover it. This is frustrating for those with conditions that won’t be covered. But it does make sense. You can’t just sign up for insurance when you need to use it.

***
**Do I have PHI?**
***

I do. I’m young and was keen to get in whilst I had no pre-existing conditions and would have to pay the 2% loading. As I am young and healthy my premiums are quite cheap additionally I’ll save money on the dentist etc. I also value access to timely care for things that could impact my quality-of-life.

***
**So do I go out and get PHI?!**
***

There is no easy answer. I’d advise you ask yourself questions 2 &amp; 3, get some quotes and see how much it would cost. Then see if the cost is less than or equal to your answer to question 1. If it is the answer is clear. If it’s more then it depends on how risk-averse you are.

Overall, you will not die or become disabled if you do not have PHI. We have an excellent healthcare system in Australia that I am proud to be a part of and plan to work in exclusively throughout my career. But PHI will possibly save you from having a decreased quality-life for what could be a prolonged period (at a cost!)

Thought I\`d share a semi-old article I ran across about some possible advancements in the treatment/ possible "cure" for allergies. Personally found it a bit uplifting and hopefully for the future since imo not a lot of advancements are taking place. 

Cliffs: 

* The article was published in 2017, but at the University of Queensland **s*****uccessfully wiped the T-cells that have an immune memory in aminals so they were able to tolerate the protein in an allergen***
* ***How***: Use blood stem cells, insert a gene that regulates the allergen protein and we put that into the recipient. The engineered cells produce new blood cells that express the protein and target specific immune cells, 'turning off' the allergic response."
* ***Possible Application:*** Using asthma allergen, but could be applied to treat those with severe allergies to peanuts, bee venom, shell fish and other substances 
*  **Dr Steptoe said the eventual goal would be a single injected gene therapy, replacing short-term treatments that target allergy symptoms with varying degrees of effectiveness.**

The second link is a funding raising video by the University, but also address a timeline of the research essentially ***might have real-world application by 2029.*** 

Since the video was published in 2017, and he mentioned 6 or so years of additional lab research ; followed by testing in humans for an estimated 6 years before "application" 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPkMR5U3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPkMR5U3TuA)

Thought I\`d attach the link to donate just in case anyone's feeling charitable.  

I believe this research is either part of the immunology or allergy departments not totally sure.

- having a crush does indeed suck. When everything doesn’t seem to work out. 

I have no idea how much longer I can keep this feeling going , how much I can jus sit here and take one hot day and another super lonely cold day where we barely exchange any messages. I keep doing this too myself. Deep down inside I hope and hope that she will jus stop replying to me . Because deep down inside I know I’m not able to  be the one to cut off communication. I know these feelings are one side and she feels no way towards me , I mean she would have expressed some type of feelings by now. But no. Anyways I hope everyone else is having a much better time with their feelings. Let’s all remember we must keep ourselves as the priority.

2020-11-15 06:41:05 : Lost intimacy with the love of my life : ThrowRA-Huckleberry : https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/juhn44/lost_intimacy_with_the_love_of_my_life/

My \[25F\] boyfriend \[27M\] told me today that he no longer feels like a boyfriend to me and more of a best friend. He said that we do all of the things best friends do together minus the intimacy factor. We love each other and want nothing but the best for each other, but we barely every have sex. In fact, he said that he can't even see me in that way right now because it has been so long. He is hurt by the fact that our intimacy is lost. We have had this conversation before and we agreed we would both work on it but we just never did. That conversation happened just before COVID got serious in America.

For context: we do not live together, I am a full-time student, he is my first very serious boyfriend. I suffer from anxiety and depression, and have been on medication for about 7 years now, since high school. I would say that I don't have a very strong sex drive. I like sex, but it isnt something I always desire. When we would have sex, I end up getting into it and it is very enjoyable, but its rarely ever me that initiates it. 

I love this man and he loves me. We had plans for our future together and I feel like the rug has been pulled out from under me. We had a long conversation and agreed that we can't give up on what we have without giving it a fair try. I am actively looking for a relationship counselor as we have agreed to give that a try. I know that as an individual, I have self esteem and body image issues, anxiety, and depression that I need to work on for myself, but I also feel like I want him to be active in my therapy for that isolated issue. He has never experienced mental health issues like me and it is my experience that those that haven't are so in the dark with how it feels. I want him to gain insight about what goes on in my head as well as work on intimacy and communication issues that we have. It is my opinion that if we learn relationship skills now, then we will set ourselves up for a happy marriage in the future. Not to say that marriage doesnt always take work, because I'm aware that it does.

So... my advice request: If anyone has any advice on how to approach couples counseling (because I'm very nervous), general advice on the situation, and even some recommendations on books or podcasts that may be helpful to this situation: both directed at couples/intimacy and/or for help for myself regarding self-esteem. 

Thanks in advance, sorry for the length of this post: this sort of doubled as dumping some raw feelings i had.

Fantastic game but if I didn’t have the walkthrough I would be completely lost. For instance the sphere with the note in it, there is not a single indication that says you have use the Vice in the basement to break it open.

2020-11-15 06:41:11 : Cave biome ideas : wielderofFire1051 : https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/juhn5k/cave_biome_ideas/

This is a bit of a compilation of some cave biome ideas I’ve come up with and have seen people floating around as popular. I really love that Mojang is adding biomes unique to the underground and I would love as many as possible, including at least few of these!

1. Slime caves that replace slime junks. 

Made up of slime blocks and some kind of “slimey” stone. Contains high population of slimes and possibly new kinds of slimes. Would be cool if some places had a floor of slime blocks and you bounced high as you ran across it, especially if you also had to be careful with stalagmites above!

2. Infested cave

A cave with a high population of arthropods, including new arthropod types. Made up of cob webs, “webby” stone and maybe even “webbier web”. Lots of silverfish stone blocks. 

3. Lava Caves

Caves that only generate at diamond level, would have massive lava pools and lava falls with lots of diamond ore beneath the lava. Could be made up of regular stone or a charred stone variant, as well as possibly a few magma blocks, a bit of obsidian and/or basalt. Enough lava to make it feel as dangerous as the nether but still let it retain the identity of a cave. Would be cool if people felt the need to use fire resistance to mine diamonds. Could be a place to find a new ore like sulfur, which could be used to craft gunpowder or as an ingredient in new fire works and explosives. 

4. Mushroom caves

Caves with mycelium floors, lots of fully grown mushrooms and possibly a few new mushroom and fungi. Maybe new kinds of stews can be crafted with ingredients from this biome. 

5. Frozen cave

Cave made up of ice and snow, especially taking advantage of powdered snow to try and freeze the player. Strays would spawn here. Could have icy stalactites and stalagmites so maybe it could be a could variant if the drip stones cave. 

6. Aquatic caves

No I don’t just mean caves with lots of water in them. I mean caves with actual ocean features like kelp, sea grass, turtles, squids, the glow squid, tropical fish, cod, salmon and drowned. These could be located beneath or connected to ocean ravines. Would be a place to find salt ore, which would increase food saturation by crafting it with cooked food, could be an ingredient in new food items, and could be a way to ward off or damage mobs like slime by placing it like redstone. Other variants of aquatic caves could be cool too, a marsh cave with lily pads and mossy cobble, and lots of clay and sand for example. These could also just be variants of the lush caves and underwater caves. 

7. Collapsing caverns

Caves made up of gravity blocks that collapse very easily.

I'm 30F and consider myself a pessimist and very introverted - posting here has been a lot of trial and error but I have managed to talk to some cool people. It's always a pleasant surprise when you find someone you actually click with. It's rare, but that's what makes it worthwhile in my opinion and there's nothing wrong with being selective. I don't take ghosting personally and don't get why most people do to be honest.   


My interests are fleeting and I have no passion. It ranges from fitness to drawing to video games (mainly RPG).   


I have a cat. He is the best.   


I listen to a lot of crime docs which doesn't help when you're already a cynical person but I do it anyway.   


I like horror movies. Mainly psyc horrors.   


I always urge people to browse my history - it's there for a reason. I don't want either party to waste time. I'm here to make friends, not for someone to give me advice about life or tell me how my views are "wrong" - so if that's what you're planning to do, sooner or later the conversation will end and it's just pointless. Save your time and message someone else.

I came to reddit to see if I could find anything and was struct by this comment: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/j47m8f/discussionspoilers\_a\_deadly\_education\_scholomance/g7t5e51?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/j47m8f/discussionspoilers_a_deadly_education_scholomance/g7t5e51?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

I don't think Orion is a construct at all but I think there's something off about him, just like there is something off about El. As somebody who has a lot of experience in the area and was able to heavily relate to El especially, they both struck me as being kind of autistic. 

Orion has been obsessed with killing mals since before he could walk, to an almost absurd degree. I'm surprised the incident where he mistakenly attacked the shielders in the graduation hall hasn't happened before, or rather that there hasn't been any collateral damage. His lack of caring for his fellow enclavers and inability to sympathize with their fear of death also strikes me as the kind of thing I'd have. 

El is even more blatant. She's a loner who has trouble forming bonds of friendship with other people . She's gotten better at it since she was a little kid but she still thinks of herself as a work in progress in that respect and very much is. She has an angry internal monologue going for much of the book in large part it seems due to her inability to socially vibe with her peers. Her dark wizard superiority complex seems to be a result of this frustration rather then it being the other way around.

2020-11-15 06:42:08 : Holophrasis: Korean : andrewklee : https://www.reddit.com/r/LingAnthFall2020/comments/juhni2/holophrasis_korean/

Andrew Lee

My language of interest is Korean, which is part of the Koreanic language family and is spoken by more than 75 million people. It is primarily spoken on the Korean peninsula, where it is the official language of both North Korea and South Korea. Korean is also spoken by more than 2 million people in China (many in Manchuria and provinces close to North Korea), and significant communities of Korean speakers also live in Japan, Russia, and the United States. Although Korean is classified as part of its own language family, there are many theories that have tried to explain its origins. The most prominent one is the Altaic language family hypothesis, which argues that both Korean and Japanese are linked to languages originating in central Asia including Turkish and Mongolian due to similarities in grammar structure and vocabulary. However, this hypothesis is unproven and the origins of Korean are not exactly known.

Holophrasis is when one language uses a single term for an idea or phrase that takes multiple words to explain in another language. In his work, Boas (1911) divides holophrasis into being either lexical or grammatical. Lexical holophrasis is when one word describes an idea that another language needs multiple words to express, while grammatical holophrasis is when one word accomplishes a grammatical function that another language again needs multiple words to express. For this project, I used the Naver Korean-English Dictionary.

My first lexical holophrasis is the word ipak or 입학. 입학 means admission or entrance to a school, and is clearly an example of lexical holophrasis because many more words are needed in English to express the idea that 입학 communicates in Korean. In my experiences, I've heard 입학 used mainly in reference to being admitted to college. This is likely because the college application process is very competitive in South Korea, as students spend their entire educational lives preparing for a standardized nationwide test that will determine the colleges they are able to attend.

The next word I chose for lexical holophrasis was doljabi or 돌잡이. 돌잡이 is a ceremony that is part of a child's first birthday in Korea where they select an object among many items that indicate their fortune. Again, it is clear that this is a lexical holophrasis because 돌잡 requires several words to explain in English. 돌잡이 is a specific part of Korean culture, as the different items during the ritual symbolize different fortunes; for example, picking a pencil is said to determine academic success while picking money is said to symbolize future wealth.

In Korean, pronouns can indicate whether the speaker is talking to someone older than oneself. In this example, the words 나는 (naneun) or 내가 (nega) can be used as the informal way of saying "I" when talking to someone who is younger or of the same age, while 저는 and 제가 are the formal way of saying "I" talking to someone who is older. This is clearly an example of grammatical holophrasis because English would take more words to communicate that you are speaking to someone older (ex: calling someone "Mister" or "Miss).

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wzf6i4uiicz51.png?width=555&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=708685808ef06ef9cf8fcc976afc65c9f5368f68

This phrase, bap muk uss uh or 밥 먹었어? means "Have you eaten?" and is a common greeting in Korea. This is interesting because when we look at the Korean phrase, it doesn't actually have the pronoun "you" in it—밥 translates to food and 먹었어 translates to eaten. The literal translation would be "Food eaten?" Here, the pronoun "you" is implied instead of being explicitly said like in English. This is clearly an example of grammatical holophrasis because the Korean phrase takes less words to communicate the same message compared to English.

This assignment has really helped me understand how complex languages are, and how the different nuances of each language can help us understand more about different cultures. For example, the linguistic and grammatical holophrasis examples that I examined reveal how important elements such as school admission, having meals, and honorifics have in Korean. Furthermore, words like 돌잡이 reveal a lot about particular cultural traditions specific to Korea. Overall, I believe that analyzing language through holophrasis is an important tool for linguistic anthropologists, as it does a great job decentering Indo-European languages.

2020-11-15 06:42:21 : First split from my Sex worker girlfriend : throwaway-5756493081 : https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDPartners/comments/juhnlg/first_split_from_my_sex_worker_girlfriend/

I am in love with someone with BPD and am currently dealing with our first (and maybe only, I guess it depends?) split.  Anyway I need to vent, need advice etc.  Please be nice.  

&amp;#x200B;

Let me start by saying this.  My GF is a sex worker.  I knew this when we started dating because I was once a client.  Until I wasn't, I was an idealized "favorite person" and boyfriend.  I initially tried to talk her out of dating but... I was intoxicated by just everything about her.  And she really is smart, and funny, and gorgeous.  Unfortunately, as I suspect most of you folks already thought she also has some other traits.  Major anxiety, depression, and alcoholism that is perhaps the most severe I have ever seen, (and I am a nurse).  

&amp;#x200B;

She was working independently during the week and working weekends at a "massage parlor".  Making good money (I estimate 8-12K a month), and spending it pretty much as fast as it came in.  Just throwing it away on anything and everything.  Initially she said that she wanted to get out.  She just needed a couple of months to get out of debt.  I didn't love it, but I tried not to be too judgmental because after all I was a client once upon a time.  I don't have a lot of moral hangups about SW, my primary concern was that it wasn't good for her.  Although I admit I was jealous as well.  After about a month, she quit the massage parlor d/t several factors. 1: "It felt like cheating" 2: Not knowing who was coming in the door made anxiety really bad.  3:  An overly aggressive client who hurt her (Jabbed her unprepared with his fingers).  

&amp;#x200B;

I asked her to quit as I believe she is retraumatizing herself (childhood rape).  I also got her in touch with a doctor, who got her on an SSRI for depression, and an antihistamine which helps a little with her anxiety.  As well as an initial contact with a non-profit that helps get women out of sex work (she has thus far declined to go further than speaking to an intake counselor about what they can help with).  She also has a followup appointment with a psychiatrist and psychologist this Mon (don't know if she'll actually answer the phone for these but I tried).  I offered to help with her bills if she quit... I tried, and I tried, and I tried.

Anyway she started seeing clients again without telling me until after the fact.  She says she never actually agreed to stop seeing them, and wasn't comfortable not having her independence (financial and otherwise), but still loved me and wanted me to be OK with it.  I'm not super happy, but... OK.  One step at a time.  She pretty much gets drunk before/during/after every session with a client so I figure if we can get the addiction under control (she claims to want a naltrexone injection which will severely limit the alcohol's ability to be a coping mechanism) she will be forced to actually look in the mirror and make a decision about if this is actually what she wants.  If she does then I figure I can make a decision about if this is what I want.  I can't tell you how in love I am with this woman.

We saw each other on Fri night, and had a lovely time with her and her son.  She was sober, and has been for several days, she had promised make it a full week).  She was going to drop her son off at his weekend activities on Sat, and let me know if she or her ex would have him tonight, if he took the kid she was going to come over (he technically has full custody so she gets the kid on his sufferance).  We texted this morning and everything was fine, but when she went silent for several hours rather than letting me know what the plans were I figured something happened and she was drinking.  She called early this afternoon (drinking but not yet drunk, which is a pattern when she wants to tell me something she thinks will upset me) and told me "she had something she needed to tell me" and told me she was going to Dallas next weekend with someone who I had been led to believe was "just a friend" and that they were going to meet a male and female friend of his and have sex and this would not be for money she just wanted the experience.  So... she doesn't just want to be a prostitute now she wants to be polymerous.  But she is also jealous and doesn't want to ever know about what I do.  I told her I didn't like this, and she insisted it was happening whether I liked it or not, and that she wasn't built for monogamy (she had previously told me, during the time before and after quitting the massage parlor that she wanted to be a housewife).  I told her I needed to process my feelings and we would talk about it later.  She then told me she was going to "see a client" this afternoon but would come over at 7 if I wanted and she would make dinner (a rare treat as I usually cook for us).  I agreed.  

She didn't show up or respond to the text I sent at 7:30 until 10 and initially said she didn't want to come over because she had "worked a bit" and was "inebriated".  Which I already knew, although now I suspect there were several clients in a row, but... well it doesn't suck that much more than 1.  She then said she didn't want to see my "reaction to reality".  I said OK.  She then professed her love for me, then attacked me.  Asked me what I wanted from her.  I said we can talk about it when you are aren't wasted.  She took offense at my use of the word wasted and demanded to know what I wanted from her.  My response was that we could talk about it tomorrow, but she could think on this, I want you to treat me with the same care I treat you with.  

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway she was then fairly insulting.  I tried to be reassuring, I also told her that what she was doing right now was called splitting and was likely a symptom.  She did not seem to like that, so maybe I shouldn't have said it.  She then said she was going out, (I assume to a bar to get really really really drunk and probably fuck someone else).

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway... Thanks for reading.  Any advice is welcome.  I'm hurting and I'm sure I did this all wrong.

2020-11-15 06:43:29 : My bf of a year says he loves me, “in a way.” Men, can you tell me if he just likes sex or if I should stick it out and keep working hard at our relationship? : goodpizzapizzagood : https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/juho13/my_bf_of_a_year_says_he_loves_me_in_a_way_men_can/

Im not posting on r/relationshipadvice because I really want to know from Reddit men if he is just using me for sex and companionship. 


So we’ve been together about a year, but these past two months we’ve been on again off again. So at first he was really loving and kind and cuddly, then we quarantined together after two months of dating and that was a bad idea because I can be really annoying and insecure and he has a limit. I acknowledge that. So i left and we broke up after three months of dating. Then two days later he wants me back, I wanted him back too and we were happy for a bit. 




I’m not gonna get into all the details, I’ll just sum up how it is from my perspective. I have worked hard to show love in his language; acts of service. Day in day out, “how can I help? What can I do for you?” I am physical touch so he also gets lots of cuddles and kisses and sex. Also, I love sex, we have sex constantly. He just doesn’t reciprocate. 




He doesn’t really cuddle me unless I cuddle him first. For some reason, he only ever kisses me, or touches my vagina in order to get me wet if he wants sex, and even then we kiss for like 30 sec. and he just rubs around until I’m ready, nothing good. He never compliments me (he has complimented me twice) and he won’t hold my hand in public because he hates pda, and we can’t hold hands in the car cause his extra hand holds his vape. If he ever does touch me or cuddle me in any way, he grabs my boobs and my butt, he never touches any other part of my body much. He doesn’t do any acts of service for me unless it’s picking me up so we can hangout. And overall, I just don’t feel that spark from him that I want to feel. Even during sex, it just feels so biological, I don’t feel emotionally connected to him at all. 




And you guys might just say, why haven’t you broken up with him, why don’t you communicate at least. Let me sum up a time line really fast;
I’m his first gf so at first I thought, “he’ll get the hang of it, well work on it and be fine,” and when that didn’t pan out I decided I’ll tell him but at the time, I didn’t know how to express what i was feeling, so I tried my best, sometimes, he interpreted it weird and while he had the spirit, he was wrong. And sometimes, he would do it once or twice and then never again, (for example, fingering me as foreplay or kissing me more often) 


As for the why haven’t you broken up with him, well I’m lonely. (Saddest way to put it) and I have anxiety and I’ve gotten used to him and feel safe around him so I’ve had a hard time trying to branch out. 



And as for people thinking, “he is so obviously using you, are you dumb?” I say, our “problems” aren’t every day. We actually have tons of fun just hanging out and talking or getting food. Also, sometimes he is very very sweet and I just believe he loves me all over again. For example I mentioned a stuffed animal I had when I was a girl and then he bought it for me. Once he bought me my favorite brownies and then made a frosting heart in the middle. He offers to help pay for bc, if Im ever emotional he will just let me cry and cry in his arms, if he ever grabs food, he’ll grab me some too. These little things that I notice and make me think he does love me. 




I have more to say but honestly I should be done now. I just feel used. I feel second best. I feel like I put in effort. I try to make sex fun and passionate or kinky. I am romantic and loving, I love him. And I don’t get that from him. I just think I’m finally at a place in my life where I could leave him, but as I said, it’s hard when I think he might love me. So men, is this a guy thing? Is he just bad at showing love? Is he bad at connecting? He’s very sweet to me he’s just not loving. I asked him if he does love me and he says he loves me “in a way,” I have no idea what that means.

2020-11-15 06:43:23 : Thoughts on the Key oh Aaravos : cbstecher : https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDragonPrince/comments/juhnzz/thoughts_on_the_key_oh_aaravos/

I'm not normally one to post about theories, since I find that they're usually too unfounded to really get invested in, but I have one idea about Dark Magic,  Arcanums, and the Key of Aaravos.

I always found it kind of wierd that we only know of two people connected to Arcanums they weren't born with in all of Xadian history - Callum and Aaravos. So this got me thinking about a common thread they both might have, which lead me to the Key of Aaravos.

I suspect that there's a bit more to the Key than being a cube with Detect Magic enchanted onto it, and I'm guessing what it does is channel the Arcanum of the Primal Sources into willing and able vessels - in this case, Callum and Aaravos. This would mean that the Key is necessary to forge connections you're not born with.

I also suspect that connecting to an Arcanum is principally Dark Magic as well, due to the effective similarities between using a magic component for single use, and "connecting" to one for multi-use. It also explains why Callum and Aaravos could use the Key in this way - they each use(d) Dark Magic before the Key connected them to an Arcanum.

If my Theory is correct, then Aaravos built is Key for the express purpose of connecting to the other Arcanums, and taught Humanity Dark Magic as a kind of budget-Key Magic, before losing it at some point in time. But when he hears about a human that can use Primal Magic without a Primal Stone, then he will know where his Key is,  which I anticipate he will then use (after he procures it, of course) to reconnect to the Star Arcanum he was ostensibly blocked from fully accessing, and he will be virtually unstoppable. 


TL;DR I think the Key of Aaravos is a catalyst that uses Dark Magic to connect its user to an Arcanum is they understand it well enough to use it.

I need help finding this movie I watched when I was 5 and it's just stuck in my head.

From what I remember, there are a group of adults near some waterhole kind of thing. There's a sign that says no children allowed. The adults go through but two of the men fall into the waterhole and they turn into teenagers.

Witches (not sure if they actually are, but looked like it to me) try to catch these teenagers, and these witches love butter. The children are then put into a cage surrounded by all these witches. There are other children with them. There's only pebbles in a plate in front of them which is their only food. Te catch is that the pebbles turn them into butter.

One of the other children, a boy can't take it anymore and eats a pebble with the other kids saying no don't do it! He turns into a block of butter, and two witches come in to take it away, while our two main boys try to fight and get through.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't remember anything else. This was aired in the late 2000's on a channel in South Australia if that helps. Thank you.

So I installed transmission-openvpn container and it was working great. Decided to put in jackett, sonarr and couchpotato. Couchpotato (and presumably the rest) could not communicate with transmission. I looked into it and it seemed like I had to change something in settings.json. Long story short, I can no longer reach localhost;9091 - I get this "9091/transmission/web/transmissionweb/transmissionweb/transmissionweb/transmissionweb/transmissionweb/transmissionweb/transmissionweb/transmissionweb/transmissionweb/transmissionweb/transmissionweb/transmissionweb/transmissionweb/transmissionweb/transmissionweb/transmissionweb/transmissionweb/transmissionweb/transmissionweb/"

I have tried to add myself to the whitelist to get around it and I have also gotten various error messages as I have changed and reinstalled the container but to no avail, this always sticks. I also deleted the cookies from firefox in an attempt to get rid of this. 

As anyone encountered something similar? any ideas? 

Transmission successfully runs as I can check on my tracker that I am seeding what I had on there before I started tinkering, I just can't reach it. 

Been googling and trying various things as others have had similar issues but not always identical. I have deleted and rebuilt the files several times.

From my last post (link here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/violinist/comments/je5oyu/how\_to\_tell\_if\_a\_violin\_is\_dark\_or\_bright\_sounding/](https://www.reddit.com/r/violinist/comments/je5oyu/how_to_tell_if_a_violin_is_dark_or_bright_sounding/))  


**Sample Clip:** [https://clyp.it/4skpnx51](https://clyp.it/4skpnx51) (for your naruto fans lol)  
**PS: The clip is unedited and raw, (NO reverb, EQ, compression, etc)**

  
The violin that I'm using: Rudoulf Doetsch (Guarani Model). I bought it a long time ago from my violin teacher.   
I'm planning to upgrade my violin in the near future as I have been looking to upgrade for some time, but work and other obligations have pushed that back, but if it's a good backup instrument I'll keep it rather than trading it in.   


Once again, I thank everyone on this subreddit, you guys are the best with the helpful and quick feedback!

2020-11-15 06:44:17 : Defensive players updates? : that_guy_dave1 : https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/juhocb/defensive_players_updates/

I'm in a keepers league with defensive players in Yahoo but there barely seems to be any updates on there nor here. They change the players status but rarely is there a description on the injury or an indication if he will play.

Even when I google the players name, there isn't much out there.

Where do you bros go to get updates?

I've been burned by Mike Hilton too many times and Jeremy Chinn (who is a damn superstar!) just last week.

Can't afford to start injured players at this stage of the season!

Came across this unexpected field in three of the applications I'm currently filling up. 

Would be great if someone could explain the potential ramifications of answering/not answering this one. 

Obviously, I am applying to multiple schools. But how would it affect my application if I -

(a). Name all the others, numbering around 8 in total
(b). Name a couple, probably the lower ranked ones 
(c). Didn't name any at all 

Which one of these would be the smartest option? Also, do schools actually run any kind of cross-program check to verify this? 

Thanks a load!

Hello! I moved into a new home and am trying to get my kitchen faucet handle off so I can replace the o-ring and hopefully fix the leak. It is a two handle faucet. However no matter what I do I can’t pop the handle off, even after unscrewing the hex nail, putting lubrication on it and tapping it with a hammer. Does anyone have any suggestions?

2020-11-15 06:45:32 : Repost- first pc, $700-800 budget : FearedOkapi : https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/juhosy/repost_first_pc_700800_budget/

&gt;**What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.**
 
I will primarily be using this for gaming, but would like the capability to potentionally use it for streaming. The types of games I’m most interested in are minecraft, rocket league, and indie games like pocket mirror or undertale.
 
&gt;**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 
 
$1000, but this needs to include monitor, keyboard, mouse, windows copy, ect. Basically the entire setup. 

For the pc alone the max I’m wanting to go is $750-800. Preferably below.
 
&gt;**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** 
 
I plan to purchase in a month or two. I understand this means some things will be out of date but what I really need right now is a good base idea of what to get.
 
&gt;**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc\)** 
 
Tower needs to be included, prefer OS as well, and of course the main hardware. Basically the stuff that you have to have or the computer will not run. If the build is going to be above $750 then it needs to include monitor, keyboard, mouse.
 
&gt;**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 
 
I live near NC US, I do not have easy access to a micro centre but if necessary I may be able to take a long trip to one.
 
&gt;**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** 
 
None.
 
&gt;**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 
 
Maybe, but currently no.
 
&gt;**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**
 
Not really, but I would like to have at least 16gb of ram.
 
&gt;**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**
 
Nope! This is my first pc and I don’t care if it aesthetically looks nice or not. So long as it gets the job done I’m happy!
 
&gt;**Do you need a copy of Windows included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference?**
 
If above $750, yes. I do not have a preference but would love recommendations for the build.
 
&gt;**Extra info or particulars:**

This is my very first gaming pc, I haven’t even touched a gaming pc before. So this means I’m very new to the world of pcs. If you have any recommendations for anything(even just resources to check out), even if it isn’t included in the build, I’d seriously appreciate it. 

This pc also doesn’t need to be top of the line, going to play all the top games at full FPS, that would be awesome if it could be, but I’m also willing to just have a solid foundation of a computer. One that I can build on if I want too. 

Thank you for your time, I appreciate you even taking the time to read this.

2020-11-15 06:45:24 : This game is 110% junk and a complete waste of $60 : Awsomesauce898 : https://www.reddit.com/r/blackopscoldwar/comments/juhor3/this_game_is_110_junk_and_a_complete_waste_of_60/

Alright. So I really wanted to give this game a chance. After game breaking campaign, multiplayer, and zombies issues. I have tried and tried to give this game a chance. I have had nothing but buyers remorse and regret on this game. 

Campaign will either kick you to the main screen with an error message or completely shut down the console. Cut scenes will freeze and stutter even with 1 gbps speeds. 

Zombies had multiple issues  to include not picking up weapons, not being able to buy ammo, mystery box not in locating that light is coming from. I've played 5 games 3 of which I would buy ammo and would not recieve it, yet it would still take the money. And all 5 I could not get a second weapon. Just primary and fists. 

Multiplayer play is a complete joke. There are free to play games with  smoother and better gameplay than this 60 dollar "Triple A" title. 

Hopefully support and updates will continue to happen for modern warfare, since it is a far superior game than this hunk of fermented horse shit.

My dad has passed away and I want to give my mom a safeguard in case she falls, so she can call out to Google.
However, when I say "call &lt;name&gt;", it always gives a list of variants of the name with/without/partial family name and keeps asking which one.
I figured setting household contacts could help, but I don't see the option "Your people" on her tablet.
https://support.google.com/assistant/answer/9860631?hl=en

Other things I tried: install original Google contact app, merge duplicate contacts, remove contacts and add contacts at again.

Her Android phone is too old for the app.

Anyone experienced this before?
Thanks...

2020-11-15 06:45:56 : Top 5 SEO trends in 2020 : ProlificDigital : https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO_Tricks/comments/juhoyv/top_5_seo_trends_in_2020/

 

If you are planning to create an SEO campaign for your business, it is important to have a clear understanding of the SEO trends that exist out there. That’s because following SEO trends will help you to get the most out of SEO and improve your chances of securing better rankings on search engine results pages. Here are the most prominent SEO trends that you can follow. If you are looking for SEO services, make sure that your digital marketing &amp; SEO agency is aware of these trends and adheres to these trends when launching your SEO strategy.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qw8f4l85ocz51.png?width=5100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=45bdf942b592464c92ab4ce839be70cf6ff1963c

Google is no longer a search engine. Instead, you can call it as an answer engine. This is where you should pay special attention to the keywords used in your marketing campaigns. It is better to use one of the reliable keyword research tools and locate the best keywords. Some keyword research tools that can deliver durable returns to you include [SEMrush](https://www.semrush.com/), [Google Keyword Planner](https://ads.google.com/intl/en_lk/home/tools/keyword-planner/), [UberSuggest](https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/) and [Ahrefs](https://ahrefs.com/). You should look for popular keywords, which have a relatively lower demand. Keyword difficulty should be low as well. If you are asking the web design London Company 

to work on the content of the website, they should provide all the keywords.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mcv97hg8ocz51.png?width=5100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bdacbd80a0faa665d38973f797aa52d8ab2599cc

Video marketing will be one of the most dominating digital marketing trends for 2020. Hence, you should think about using more videos in your SEO strategy. People who watch videos online is increasing rapidly along with time. According to research conducted by [Zenith Media](https://www.zenithmedia.com/) back in the year 2018, the average online video watching time per person is around 67 minutes. This is expected to increase up to 100 minutes by the year 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hmkew1e9ocz51.png?width=5100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d693ed59a6ebf89524f48a9e75e5efafe0cf8232

If you can take your time to develop high-quality content, you can ensure receiving amazing returns at the end of the day. Make sure that your content is written by an expert writer. It should not have any spelling or grammar mistakes. Content should be associated with an authority as well. On top of everything, you must ensure that your content is delivering trustworthiness. Then you can easily increase your chances of securing better returns. Therefore, it is worthy to invest money on content while managing a search engine optimisation campaign.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ux99k28bocz51.png?width=5100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b2cb98d78ed2ec2776b4770f2dc4f30fe66f3dbd

It is important to develop an SEO strategy based on the analysis of quantitative and qualitative data. Ensure that you are hiring an SEO London expert who has the knowledge and expertise to do it. Every business out there has lots of data collected from customers. You should analyse those data and visualize them by applying the principles of data science. Then you can figure out the reasons why people tend to purchase products or services that you offer. Then you can highlight the pain points of customers with your digital marketing campaigns. On the other hand, you can use data to figure out the sources of unusual traffic, web pages that have not been crawled by the search engines and discover the referral sources that convert traffic.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7l6r7a0eocz51.png?width=5100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff115b091263c88c6b89b6bbc2ac6a64044a597d

While planning an SEO campaign, you should heavily focus on voice search optimisation. That’s because people in today’s world tend to use voice assistants such as [Amazon Alexa](https://alexa.amazon.com/), [Google Voice Assistant](https://assistant.google.com/), and [Siri](https://www.apple.com/siri/) to search for what they want on the internet. Hence, you should use trigger words such as “best”, “what” and “how” and optimize your content for voice searches.

If you can stick to these SEO trends, you can end up with getting best returns out of your SEO campaigns.

2020-11-15 06:46:10 : Laptop (wired) can only achieve half of the internet speed as the desktop : splitxfile : https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeNetworking/comments/juhp1w/laptop_wired_can_only_achieve_half_of_the/

 

Dear all,

I  recently upgraded my internet speed (Verizon fios). My desktop can  achieve the full speed (&gt;200Mbps) and my laptop can only achieve  roughly half of that speed.

Desktop: Win 7, wired to a switch then to the fios router/gateway, (very old rig assembled by myself)

Laptop: Win 10, wired directly to the fios router/gateway, (Lenovo, about 2 year old)

They both have a 1Gbps Ethernet card, 24G memory and all wired by CAT5e cables. Tested on [speedtest.net](https://speedtest.net/).  A strange thing is the laptop shows my location as "Google private  cloud" instead of "Verizon" as in the desktop. Not sure why is that.

Even  my cell phone can achieve &gt;200Mbps through the wireless, which makes  no sense why the laptop can only achieve half of that speed. Appreciate  any comments.

One of my best friends uses extreme self deprecation as the majority of her conversation material. Every interaction stops or is halted  by “ im sorry i’ll stop bothering you i’ll leave you alone forever now i’m sorry”. I love her so much, it physically hurts me to hear these things said about her, from her, especially when I am already dealing with a lot of internal issues myself. I leave each conversation exhausted from trying to deny her remarks and reassure her and make her feel better but it obviously doesn’t work, and I can’t keep this up. 
I don’t know how to set boundaries with anyone but especially not in this situation where she could take it as confirmation that she is in  fact the worlds biggest mistake of life. (and i can’t help but feel frustrated by such exaggerations that couldn’t possibly be real for anyone in the whole world. nobody is a mistake let alone gods biggest?? i know i shouldn’t be bothered by it though bc that isn’t the real problem)
i don’t know what to do i’m so tired but i love her so much

How are these factors expected to impact him upon return: could the backfield get more complicated (Ahmed had some nice plays - could he remain involved ROS, taking some touches from Gaskin?

Apologies as I’m on mobile. I just found this forum after trying to find a way to help my husband. 

Backstory- His doctor put him on Cymbalta about five or so years ago (before we met because I would have questioned that). He was given it after he had lipomas removed from his chest to manage the pain and relax the muscles. He was put on 60mgs immediately and has been taking it ever since. An immediate high dose of a medicine primarily used for anxiety to treat pain that high strength ibuprofen probably could have handled. Now a major problem with his doctor is he is stingy and kind is an a-hole about refills. He will drag his feet sending them or demand he make an appointment but only let him make the appointment for after he will have run out and have no more pills. I dont know why he does this I’ve never seen a doctor act the way this man does with my husband. It’s completely baffling and completely unprofessional. 

  Our issue right now is for the past two weeks before his pills ran out we had been trying to get his prescription refilled. The pharmacy sent faxes and called, we called. Most days we got their answering service who informed us they decided to close early for the day and were gone. We finally got to speak with someone on Thursday and she rudely told my husband he needs to make an appointment. I won’t type out the entire rude insane conversation but he asked if he could get a single refill because he was about to be out of pills and she basically said she had to ask the doctor and hung up on us. We called back and got voicemail services. He had taken his last pill that day. He is in withdrawal now and is a mess. The first night was the worst I’ve ever seen him. He used to be able to go 3-4 days before it started but this time he only made it one day. Night came and he became erratic, and it aggravated his Tourette’s so he would just sit there cry and mutter words over and over with no control. 

We’ve been maintaining him with Advil and just sitting still so he doesn’t feel like his heads exploding but he can’t have his eyes open while moving at all or his equilibrium knocks him over. I’m so worried for him, he’s so upset and I’m pain and having to call off two days of work is making him more nervous and probably making it worse. Does anyone have any tips to deal with the withdrawal? I never knew it was this bad, especially with this specific medication, until I looked into it. 

Also, i know he probably should have asked more about it but when he was prescribed this medication he was in pain constantly from the lipomas and trusted what the doctor told him of it fixing his problems, especially since he has a chronic lipoma disease and still has multiple in his body that will eventually require surgery. He was told this would make them not hurt and that was his main concern. He didn’t find out about the anxiety/withdrawal issues until later when he was already taking it consistently.

2020-11-15 06:46:55 : How can i(M21)properly communicate with my gf (F21)who has a terminally ill father. : Dweebzster : https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/juhpck/how_can_im21properly_communicate_with_my_gf/

So I’ve been dating my gf for about 6 months now and her dad has progressively been getting worse. It’s been effecting her a lot as I understand losing a parent is hard. Aside from her dad being sick she is the head of her house along side her sister so she has a lot of responsibilities. When we first started dating everything was great perfectly happy, although as time passed I realized how shes changed and she doesn’t treat me with the same love and affection anymore. Being her Bf I just want to support her and be by her side. There is a lack of communication between us and I often get frustrated because I don’t know what to do nor what is going on. 
  I’ve lucky haven’t lost a close family member so this is a new concept for me, one I don’t quiet understand how to approach. She pushes me away and often doesn’t text me or call me nor reply or answer to texts for a long period of time. I try to give her space but I never get a response back and I have to initiate a conversation. She doesn’t let me see her and I feel excluded and unwanted which is hurtful because I want to help but I don’t know how. She feels emotionless to everything and anything I say to her just seems to bounce off her.So what I essentially would like to know is how can I communicate to her In a way that is endearing and cheerful, that can also spark up her feelings again. To make her feel “alive”.

Quick suggestion: The “Looking For” flair is pretty vague, as is “Help”, and I feel like they’re often misused. 

Could we maybe get something like...

• “Looking For Suggestions”
• “Help Me Find This Book”
• “Technical Help” / “App Issues”
• “Writing Advice”
•  “Getting More Reads”

These topics seem to come up enough to replace those categories. Just a thought...

My mother gave me a Lot of comic books her job was gonna throwaway. So I naturally read some and got interested in comic book collecting. This is my current [comic book collection](https://imgur.com/gallery/XiFTu76). Most of them are from the ones I was given, except the Spawn comics. I was told to focus less on the prices/popularity of comics when you start off and just get things that catch your eye or involve a character you like. If any one has any advice for a new collector, feel free to drop some knowledge in the comments. Good website to get comics from, how to store them properly to not damage them, where to find the value of comics, anything is appropriate. Thanks in advance.

I'm a 29yr old, 5"4", 112Ib, black Cis female currently residing in NYC.  Raised in Kenya and the great state of NY. Reaching out to the world for my compatible life companion. 

I love nature and animals. Love hiking, and running outdoors. Enjoy camping. Learning to swim and play tennis. Enjoy badminton but haven't played it in ages. Wanted to learn to dance swing and salsa but covid happened. You'll probably catch me reading science fiction, tubing in to house building shows, and watching old movies. William Powell is my bae. Also learning German.

My dream home is by the water as the sound of water soothes me. I have 2 cats that I can never compromise on as they are my family. Probably the only babies I'll ever have unless you have pets as well. 

Work as a Registered Nurse and I'm fairly financially stable. Wish to FIRE and travel the world. See myself moving to California for a travel gig then splitting residence between Europe?/NZ? and US post covid. It's been said that man proposes, God disposes.....

Agnostic. Vegan. Environmentally friendly. Recently got my electric ride 😊😊😊. Progressive politically. So proud that AOC is my rep. 


You: Looking for a best friend you are attracted to with whom you'll age with and travel the world with. 
Enjoy being active and learning new skills. 
Hope your job is flexible. Need to be financially stable. Care about animals and the environment. You need to realize that my 2 cats are not negotiable. I truly believe animals are not inferior, simply different.

I’ve looked at the picture. Hard. I don’t see how it could be Ganondorf from BOTW2 as some are saying. 

Firstly, it would suggest that Ganondorfs corpse has been sealed down there for just 100 years, it looks to me he’s been sealed there for millennia.. or longer.

Secondly. Physically, both figures despite the similarities, look different. Ganondorf in BOTW2 looks far more muscular, larger, taller and strapping even in corpse form (obviously even bigger in life form) than the figure from AOC. His face is much broader. The AOC figure looks rather feminine in stature despite being male. 

I personally think the AOC’ figure is a gyrahim type of character, being the eyes and reporter to Ganondorf, as communicated by the corrupted ancient core.

Potentially NSFW? I'm marking it as such just in case.

  
Pretty much the title. Not sure if this is the right place to be asking this. I know some priests frequent this sub, so maybe they have input that could prove to be useful? 

I'm traumatized. Diagnosed w/PTSD, never sleep, self-harm issues, I'll be lucky to live past 30, yada yada. I can't say I really feel like a very faithful person most of the time,  or even particularly attached to Catholicism. If I wasn't raised Catholic I doubt I'd be one tbh. Much of the time it feels like a bunch of extra chores tacked onto my already complicated life haha.

I'm not expecting pity about my life story or anything, just setting the backdrop for my problem. Despite my complicated relationship with the Church, I still feel obligated to at least do the bare minimum to be a religious person. That means participating in the Sacraments, trying to pray if I can get the energy to, etc. I'm under no illusions that I wouldn't be regarded as a very good Catholic by...anyone, but I the way I see it can't hurt to try at least, especially given my low life expectancy.

Recently my condition has worsened considerably, to the point where I'm staying up three days at a time, and where leaving my residence to even buy a meal is incredibly taxing, to the point where I usually just shut down for a few hours afterward. I've managed to make it to Mass a few times (covid, fortunately, isn't much of an issue in my tiny town, so Mass is still in session, lest you're worried), but like I said, the idea of venturing outside to participate in such a thing is terrifying and awful. That fear is slowly extending into things like praying on my own or even just discussing religion. I feel like that because I'm not going out and interacting with a parish at all that I'm throwing away the chance I've been given at eternal life, and that ultimately I'm just a disappointment in the eyes of the Church. 

I don't interact with other parishioners at all, I find it incredibly difficult to actually focus on the service when it's happening, and as a consequence I feel like my faith is slipping, and my desire to be an active participant of this religion, which has felt pretty forced from the get-go, has waned significantly. (Maybe desire isn't the right word. I still want to be Catholic, but I'm finding participating in the basic functions of this religion to be incredibly hard.)

Someone on an IRC chat I barely talk in said that I can't really be blamed for struggling to make it to services because of my mental illness, but I don't want to use something like that as a justification for being a lackluster Catholic. 

Basically I guess what I'm asking, to priests or to someone who's been in a situation similar to mine, how do I reignite my Faith to the point where I don't dread getting up on Sunday? I feel like I'm going about this religion thing in the wrong way, especially looking at the devotion of some of the people on this sub and in other places. And with, y'know, eternal consequences being a thing, I don't want to fuck up my afterlife anymore than I have my current one. 

Sorry if this doesn't fit the sub or is unclear, I'll delete it if it causes issues.

Now this one actually has lore. In this quest, you are a warrior taking down a group of Wu Lin known as the Heirs of Virupaksa that, although it is not explicitly stated, I believe are trying to conquer Heathmoor. There are a few this I noticed in this one.

First, the obvious one. In the very beginning it states that the story of you fighting the Heirs was written in an ancient scroll found in an old cathedral in the Blackstone Hills. This is interesting because normally China and Heathmoor kinda just...don’t mess with each other. It’s also said that the scroll predates the Cataclysm, but the claims aren’t fully supported. The other two things I noticed was that firstly, most of the names of the Wu Lin you face are actually the names of armor sets, meaning that the sets were named after real people that originally designed or wore them. The other thing is that in Buddhism Virupaksa, or Virupaksha, is the Guardian King of the West. Since the group is known as the Heirs of Virupaksa, this means that they believe that they are meant to inherit the west, aka Heathmoor, and were most likely trying to conquer it. Feel free add to it what you think fits.

2020-11-15 06:49:06 : Warriors of the North (Open to Stark host.) : TheZaxInWinterfell : https://www.reddit.com/r/IronThroneRP/comments/juhq65/warriors_of_the_north_open_to_stark_host/

It was hardly daybreak when the Stark army breached the hill a few hundred yards from The Crossing. His host arrayed out over the road behind him, his son, nephew Alaric, he also made sure to keep Lady Whitehill close at hand during their travels. To be sure no harm befell her and he had assigned a portion of his own guard to watch the young woman. 

He summoned his man Heward to his position, he gave orders to summon all his bannermen to the front of the line, he had some time to speak before they arrived he would catch them all up to speed here. He was not asking for their assistance but commanding it, war was upon them, Blackfyre had landed and allegiance needed to be made. 

It was clear which side he must lay his sword to, if he wanted his son to return a harsh man like Blackfyre could make that happen. Aegon was not his King that much was certain, the man killed his nephew even if the rumors were so true. No man would follow a man of the North that fought with Kinslayers, he would not insult the honor of his Lord’s so.

He had also made his mind to raise his nephew Alaric to the head of his guard, making the boy be an ever present force in his presence. He would have needed a great fighter when it came to fighting, a warrior like his nephew would make a fine Sworn Sword. 

Behind him in a wide line far across the road and field behind him were just over six thousand Northern riders, spears, and swords. Aimed at bringing peace to the Riverlands at last, and after that perhaps assisting in bringing peace to the Realm. 

Forward the host marched toward the wall of the keep with eagerness, his host did not have to feign surprise at the events. For nowhere outside of Torrhen’s tent was that info heard last night, his message from Bracken nor his knowledge of Blackfyre, he was hedging his bets close to his chest until the last moment. 

For just a moment The Bitterwolf bid his host stop and gave his Lords a moment to approach. Gathering his thoughts all the while, this would be a long day if things went poorly, if they went well it wouldn’t be any shorter besides.

For the past two years I meditated quite seriously trying to never miss a sit. The past three months however I didn’t do a single meditation. I did however notice something remarkable. 

At the end before I stopped I went through a 4 week period of intense anxiety whereafter I stopped meditation and all other spiritual practices to just be for a while. I realised this phase was probably a purification as Culadasa says.

In the few months of no meditation I actually experienced a deep integration of my expanded consciousness in my daily life. Just letting things flow and be. I was at a solid stage 7 before I stopped and although I def regressed a bit to stage 5/6 after starting a week ago, I didn’t lose any conscious capacity that I built up over the two years. I very quickly got into a solid state of metacognitive introspective awareness. 

Has anyone else experienced a sense of deep integration after taking a break from a serious practice?

Galaxy S5, klte
LineageOS 14.1

Recently my phone started rebooting randomly when doing mundane things, like browsing web and pressing "back" button. I've tried all I could think of to no avail, and decided to re-flash it, thinking it's something to do with me previously tinkering with kernel and CPU settings. 

I got 14.1 zip, Gapps 7.1, official SU package
Wipe system/data/cache, flash all of the above

Restored some apps with Titanium, did a clean reinstall on the ones that had internal backup system. It's been about 12 hours, and, to my dismay, phone rebooted again when I tried to unlock it. So far only when unlocking, but it's too early to tell. 

What steps can I take to troubleshoot it, except for not installing any apps at all, in case some of them causes the problem (there's nothing that modifies the system, mostly productivity/media stuff).
I've tried reading logcat, but right now it seem to not save anything since last reboot, but in the past I've managed to pinpoint a "page fault (11)" error, apparently right before the reboot, there was even an app PID (in retrospect, I should've recorded it and tried to find it in running processes)

Any tips will be appreciated!

Hello everyone! I plan on going to Germany to study in college. I've read up on the things I need to do, and how much money I need to have saved in order to get a visa, but I had some questions I need answered before all of that! I can't find it anywhere here either, so I thought I would ask :))

I plan on becoming a teacher, but I have no idea where to start. I have no qualifications yet aside from a few education classes and the internship I work at right now, seeing as only figured out that I wanted to be a teacher within this past semester. Here are a few of my questions:

1. Is there a specific type of degree I need to get? Education, or related to the subject I want to teach?
2. Is there a teacher certification thing over there like there is in the US (like the TELP)?
3. Do Germans have to pick which grade level they want to teach when they start their studies?
4. Is there a professional year/way to get experience teaching in Germany before I finish graduating?
5. Are there specific schools for education, or am I able to go to a regular university over there?

If I have more questions, I'll add them in as an edit. If anyone has any answers to these, they'll be very appreciated!

I've really been enjoying Valhalla, but there is one thing that's nagging me about the storytelling. I totally understand *why* it is the way it is, but it is pretty interesting imo.

In Ptolemaic Egypt, it made sense that most people would either speak Egyptian or Latin/Greek, likely a combination of those three, and thus it makes sense that every character in the game can speak to one another with no language barrier. Likewise, in Ancient Greece everyone is speaking (ancient) Greek of course, so again this problem is avoided. However, early medieval Britain is a very different situation. The biggest division is of course between the Anglo-Saxons and the Scandinavian invaders, both of whom speak with each other constantly with no language barrier in the game. However, they obviously were speaking different languages, Old English and Old Norse (both of which would have had substantial dialect variation, particularly Old Norse, but to my knowledge the various Old Norse languages were similar enough that mixed Viking crews could understand one another). I know Old Norse and Old English are related languages, but they aren't similar enough to be effortlessly mutually intelligible, not to the degree that Valhalla appears to portray. This presents an interesting dilemma for the setting that I'm sure Ubisoft had discussions about during development. You see this problem appear in science-fiction settings often, look at Mass Effect as a perfect example. Taking the time to worry about translation and linguistics is obviously not convenient for a story that doesn't integrate the language barrier as a significant plot point. Mass Effect wouldn't have worked if you had to deal with a language barrier every time you talked to an alien. Conveniently, a sci-fi setting can handwave this away with bullshit autotranslator tech that doesn't *really* make sense if you think about it too hard, but works well enough as a quick justification.

 9th Century England has the same problem as a science-fiction setting in that its really a clash of cultures. However, there isn't really any convenient way around it. Is Eivor speaking Old English? Old Norse? Both? Did Eivor learn how to speak Old English, and if so why didn't they mention that? Why would (s)he even, considering the whole invade England thing is very spontaneous. Even if that is the explanation, what about all the other Saxon and Norse characters who interact with one another? This problem is going to get even more blatant with the DLC, as now Eivor is apparently going to be fluent in both Old French and Gaelic languages as well. I also believe there may be Picts in the main game, but I haven't gotten to the northern part of the story yet so I cant say, but I imagine its the same issue. Oh and I almost forgot the whole Byzantine Hidden Ones thing, what language are *they* speaking? Do they know Old Norse for some reason? Old English? 

Its definitely a nitpick, but it keeps popping up in the back of my mind every time two characters who shouldn't be able to understand one another talk. Did they ever do any handwaving to explain this away, and I just missed it? I feel like maybe they should've at least thrown in a line that Eivor is fascinated by other languages or some bullshit, and spent free time learning them. I can't decide whether mega-handwaving like that or just blatantly ignoring language like they did is the right solution. Overall, I totally get why they chose the latter option and just didn't worry about it, it would've been pretty restricting story-wise. 

Of course, there's a chance Eivor's language ability gets explained by some Isu shit later on or whatever (no spoil pls), but that still wouldn't explain other characters. 

I'd be interested to hear what other people think on the matter. I definitely think the Viking Age is the least suitable for an AC game out of the three RPG settings, so they've had to stretch things quite a bit more across the board to accommodate it, this language issue included.

I've been on mountains and noticed birds flying below my location, near me. The birds didn't even attempt to increase their altitude in order to protect themselves.  

Does this mean that certain birds fly only up to certain altitudes even if there is oxygen at higher altitudes?

I am literally having the toughest time trying to decide on a video editing program and wanted to hear some opinions on what you have chose and why you like it. Adobe is the weird one out the bunch as it doesn't allow you to just purchase the software, you are ultimately spending an absorbant amount of money yearly. But in turn you are getting a suite of applications. 

Final cut: I am trying to get away from mac's and eventually build a new pc. But I do a lot of music production and that's my go to machine so I've been thinking about it. 

Davinci: I've heard a lot of great things about this and I've heard it's free. Thoughts?

2020-11-15 06:51:55 : Relay module connections for outputting alarm signal to environmental sensor : Admirable-Asparagus : https://www.reddit.com/r/askanelectrician/comments/juhr85/relay_module_connections_for_outputting_alarm/

Howdy, helpful electrical-minded folks!

I've got a Simon XTi-5 home security alarm panel, an [Altronix RBUL relay module](https://www.altronix.com/products/RBUL), a CyberPower UPS with [RMCARD205](https://www.cyberpower.com/hk/en/product/sku/RMCARD205#downloads) network module, and an [ENVIROSENSOR](https://www.cyberpowersystems.com/resources/envirosensor-um/). My goal is as follows: when the Simon alarm panel goes into alarm mode (for example, by a door opening while armed), it outputs a signal to the relay module that then sends a signal to the dry contacts on the ENVIROSENSOR, which then sends an email notification to me via the RMCARD205 connected to the UPS. Basically, a poor man's alarm system monitoring.

This is mostly working. The alarm panel's HW1 function is set to "Alarm", so when it enters alarm mode, it passes 12 VDC into the wires I have connected to its positive and negative terminals. These wires are connected to the positive and negative terminals of my RBUL relay board. When alarmed, I read 12 VDC across those two terminals.

Here's where I am confused. I currently have one of the dry contacts on the ENVIROSENSOR connected via a single wire to the Normally Open terminal on the relay board. When in alarm, the relay module's LED lights up, but the ENVIROSENSOR never detects a change over the wire connected to the NO terminal.

Do I have things connected correctly? Do I need an additional wire going from the COM terminal on the relay module, into the COM terminal on the ENVIROSENSOR? Is something else not correct in how I've wired the relay module to the sensor? Or, is maybe this relay module not the correct type to use with these dry contacts?

I've done wiring around the house but my knowledge of electronics at the component and wiring level is not so great. Any help is appreciated. Thanks!

2020-11-15 06:52:14 : Is distancing myself the right option? : PrinceBalor98 : https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/juhrc3/is_distancing_myself_the_right_option/

Hey all, first time posting here. About two months ago I started to see my best girl friend more than just a friend. Initially I waited things out trying to figure out what exactly I was feeling. On halloween I decided to be honest and communicate to her how I felt about her. It wasn’t until the next time we hung out where she said it was best if we didn’t date because of a few reasons. After that I decided to work towards losing these feelings. It was going fine until the other day when I realized the closer we’re getting the harder it is to lose these feelings. Mainly because after I told her how I felt we’ve been hanging out way more, mostly on her end from inviting me to go out. 

That said, after realizing this I feel I should probably distance myself a bit, not cut her out completely or anything like that but just cut back on how much we spend time together and how late we talk on the phone. I appreciate that the friendship wasn’t ruined and things never became awkward after being upfront with my feelings, I don’t want to lose her as a friend. I would appreciate any advice as to what you would do in this situation

2020-11-15 06:52:55 : How gamebreaking is magic in Demon's Souls? : Astanex : https://www.reddit.com/r/demonssouls/comments/juhrnd/how_gamebreaking_is_magic_in_demons_souls/

I started as a Barbarian (lacking a proper "Deprived" class, I went with the most poorly geared class), but leveled just enough to get Soul Arrow for a ranged option.  

It starts off doing about as much as my +3 Morning Star.  I heard magic is good, but this is making me want to do a mage build instead.  Still, I don't want to completely break the game.  Half the fun *is* the challenge.  

Do weapons catch up later?  I haven't raised my melee past 15/10 yet (10 dex for the Falchion, Giantdad wasn't around in the DeS era, so nobody tell him).

Any advice?

Hi my name is JJ I have been playing ttrpgs for about 5 years now and decided to get into DMing so this will be one of my first times running a game.

a little about the game. it would be set in the universe of MHA but the events, and people do not exist (so no worries if you aren't caught up with the show or manga they don't affect this game). the location would be placed in the US and the players would be playing as freshmen students that just passed the entrance exams.

this game will be 18+ since it will cover some more mature subjects (nothing sexual)

I plan this game to be more RP focused rather than Combat focused, that doesn't mean there wouldn't be combat but theres a good chance there could be sessions where no combat is had at all.

We would use the Open Legend system since it is very easy to use and learn and focuses more on flavor text and RPing out what you are doing rather than mechanics.

This game would take place some time on ***Mondays***

if this game would interest some people please apply here[https://app.roll20.net/lfg/listing/263705/my-hero-academia](https://app.roll20.net/lfg/listing/263705/my-hero-academia)

My girlfriend and I moved in together last January after being together for less than a year. Things were great! We spent all of our time together and had all kinds of new adventures with our own apartment.

Then, COVID hit. Hard. Then we were spending all of our time together. Smoking dumb amounts of weed and bouncing between online classes and movies all day. Talking about whatever popped into our heads at any given moment. Parts of it weren’t that bad but definitely new. 

At some point, things got bad. She lied to me about starting at onlyfans account, which I explicitly said I wasn’t really comfortable with. Sometimes, when I try to bring something up that she’s doing that bothers me, she just gets angry at me and tries to turn it around. Or I’m overreacting. Or I’m *insert reason here* It’s exhausting and it all sounds like a bunch of bullshit to get around the notion she could be doing anything wrong. 

Suddenly, since the dawn of said onlyfans account, she thinks she’s going to be a social media influencer. Which has given her a whole grandiose ego that’s damn near impossible to compete with. Honest to god, sometimes I have to fucking beg her to ask me about my day at work. (I work in a hospital so I still leave the house to go to work) She’ll tell me how many new followers she’s gotten in the day and I’ll say I’m happy for her. Then she comes back a few hours later with like 4 new followers and I’m a little less enthused. Then I’m not supportive enough and I have to be more excited for her accomplishments. It’s fucking mental at times. 

All of this is immaterial, though thank you for indulging me. Trust me, I could go on for pages about what feels wrong. 

I need out. I know it. And I feel like she knows it too. In several heated fights she’s always talked about how she’s unhappy and how she feels underappreciated. If she’s truly felt those things, this should come as some sort of relief to her too, right? 

However, right now, everything’s perfectly normal. We went and saw a movie tonight, even. If I just lay this out, it’s gonna hit her like a truck of bricks. And that’s gonna spawn a huge heated screaming fest. I don’t want to yell. I don’t want this to be ugly. 

I also don’t want to move to California with the money we don’t have, to go for jobs we don’t have to qualifications for, in a state where we don’t know anyone. 

This is super scattered and weird but I had to communicate these thoughts to other people. Our lease ends at the end of January and we’ve yet to set a concrete plan for after it. Holidays are, unfortunately, coming up again too. If anyone has ever been in this type of situation your input means the world! 

Thank you all ♥️

2020-11-15 06:53:40 : Is there a true FPS/RTS out there? : bullet1520 : https://www.reddit.com/r/RealTimeStrategy/comments/juhrx0/is_there_a_true_fpsrts_out_there/

I know there are many games in existence that sort of blur the lines. I've had fun with Battlefield's "Commander" mode, I've seen Nuclear Dawn/Natural Selection 2, watched gameplay in Savage: Battle for Newerth And yes, I've heard of Warshift, but it looks... off, in some way? I'm not sure how to describe it. But while all of them have elements of both genres blended together, none of them take the RTS part very seriously. 

I'm looking for a game in which there are a few human players on each side, and in sort of Titanfall fashion, a big battle ensues. Except instead of just accruing kills on bots... the commander player for each side actually controls things, rather than issuing basing orders to human players. Human players would still receive some commands, but their usefulness on the battlefield would be more of a control aspect; holding strategic locations, rather than just slaughtering stupid bots for points. They're there to give the commander above them an edge, rather than just for the commander to watch do all the dirty work.  
I'm talking about the human commander spawning and controlling those AI bots that run around; building things like turrets and defensive structures; delivering ammo and health drops to humans; and actually making a meaningful impact on the battlefield.

Does such a game exist? I've been searching for something like this since... damn, I don't know, probably 2008? Until then, I'd only played Brood War (since it came out) and C&amp;C, but have since vastly branched out, obviously adding the staple Starcraft 2 on its launch date. But I've never found anything quite like this. If no games like this exist, I'd probably like to begin working on one in my free time as a passion project, since I do have many (but likely not all) of the skills to do so with a game engine.

2020-11-15 06:53:34 : Certifications vs personal project : MakeMathNotWar89 : https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/juhrvy/certifications_vs_personal_project/

Hi everyone, I am currently working on acquiring some cloud knowledge via a course designed to prepare for an AWS certification and I find myself wondering if taking the exam is really worth the time and money. Just to put things into prospective, I am a moderately experienced developer who is looking to up skill. Until now I did backend and machine learning development. 

So my question would be, do you think a certification is really a game changer or personal projects are enough to show off what I can do. I understand all is relative, some shops want certifications, some do not care. But I would be curious if there is any consensus out there. Right now I am really on the fence as

1. Quite frankly certifications are expensive. 
2. I don't have a Windows box, nor easy access to one, and having to buy a laptop just to do the certification feels super stupid.
3. I would spend time in any case to do some personal project to really consolidate all the knowledge.
4. I spend 5 years in uni learning more complicated stuff. To be honest having a piece of paper from amazon thay says: "you understand vpc" feels a bit stupid when I already have one that says: "you understand the tcp/ip stack".
5. Well in the end a 1k investment in certification is well worth it if it lands me a 100k job.

Could any of you share some experiences and or opinions?

So I was reading at Wikipedia this evening that "the Toba catastrophe theory, which postulates a population bottleneck for *Homo sapiens* about 70,000 years ago, was controversial from its first proposal in the 1990s and by the 2010s [it] had very little support." [1] 

That was news to me. Does anyone know why it has very little support? I rather liked that theory at one time and had no idea that it had fallen out of favor. 

The article says that "distinctive human genetic variability has arisen as the result of the founder effect," but certainly a population bottleneck can cause a founder effect. Could an effective population size of 18,500 be considered a bottleneck (as per Huff *et al.*)? [2] 

I'm not seeing why the Toba catastrophe theory is unpopular. What am I missing?

Thinking only about the ‘cheaper model’ here - would you have preferred 

A) Series S (same power as now) but with a disc drive 

B) Series X (same power as now) but all digital like the PS5 Digital?

Advantage of A would be for people looking for a cheap new model but who have a back catalogue of discs. I know a lot of parents would prefer a cheaper model that also plays discs.

Advantage of B is that is retains the power of the bigger model just like the PS5 digital.

Personally I would prefer B - went digital last generation and have no interest in discs at all, so and All digital model would be ideal, but I know that lots of people do use discs and would like a cheaper option than the full price series x.

I got a videogame ad like once after  so many years.

If  I could install adblock on my TV, I would. But that thing got like the  first wave of youtube, it doesn't have any other streaming app and once  an ad plays in the MIDDLE of a video, it can no longer play that video.

2020-11-15 06:54:43 : I think I just figured out why ranked is so broken : Hyperion21_ : https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsSquadrons/comments/juhsbw/i_think_i_just_figured_out_why_ranked_is_so_broken/

From what I can tell, the game is applying handicap bonuses to the wrong team.

Whenever you're in a 4v5, getting a kill on defence gives you 10 morale, but if an enemy kills you while their on defence they'll get 12 morale. I've only ever seen this happen in a 4v5, and it always favors the team of 5. I feel that this is meant to be a handicap system where a team of 4 has a handicap buff to help mitigate being in a 4v5, but because of what I would assume is a 1-year development cycle crunch, probable because of the game's fire and forget marketing strategy, it got programmed to favor the wrong team.

Also, I feel the rank system's unpredictable giveths and takeths are attributed to this. I always feel like I lose a lot more rank in a 4v5 than a 5v5 when I lose, and this explanation fits that perfectly. However, this has one exception: if your team forfeit, it seems to work properly, as the first and only time my team actually surrendered, I only lost 3% of my rank. This only further proves my point, however, since forfeit is a new feature and was probably programmed correctly.

Honestly, since the rank reset feature is not well known about and the algorithm really likes to taketh more than giveth, I feel Motive should completely disable the rank system and have fleet battles be an unranked mode for the 16.5 days we have until Operation 2, and spend that time fixing everything. The rank system is this game's main criticism in the dedicated fanbase, so spending time fixing it would heavily boost the community's hope in the game and Operation 2.

Hi, 

Finally was able to take the RAV4 at high speeds after getting the Falken Wildpeak A/T Trail tires put on. They're stock size on stock rims. No other modifications. At around 75/80 mph there is some slight shake\vibration that can be felt if I  put my hand on the center console, under the seat, or when I put my hand on the gear shifter stick. What's weird is that I don't really feel it on the steering wheel. 

Any idea what is causing this? Should I take them back to the dealer?

I'm in shock. This happened yesterday.

My boyfriend and I are so in love and excited to have found each other. We met 18 months ago *after* we had each ended loveless, sexless marriages. Our joke has been that the number one phrase I've uttered to him in 2020 has been 'where are my undies' (2020 has had it's ups and downs for sure).

My boyfriend's ex-wife has had a lot of trouble letting go even though she initiated their split. Our respective shared parenting relationships with both our exes have been ok excepting her ongoing jealousy and hatred of me (whom she hasn't met yet). This has been the biggest stressor starting a relationship after the trauma of divorce.

Fast forward we have recently started seeing each other 'properly'. Last weekend he dropped a box of belongings from their former home including some laundry he'd done for their kids.

Yesterday she called. Spitting! 12/10 furious. Somehow a pair of my undies (clean) had made their way into the laundry in the box and to her house. There was no way to explain or defend. She was screaming and crying.

It gets worse. Turns out last week she had visited his home, apparently to help by feeding his cat while he was at work. She had seen a different pile of laundry in his bedroom and a different pair undies which for some reason she had assumed were hers so she took them. It wasn't until she found the wayward pair in the box that she realised they were also mine....and she had been wearing them.

I'm mortified, he's mortified, she's FURIOUS. I need therapy. He needs therapy. She needs therapy. She's quite the firecracker and the explosions are still being heard.

TL;DR My boyfriend's ex-wife found some of my undies AND WORE THEM by accident

Throwaway because I don't want this on my main. All the normal disclaimers: first time poster, mobile, etc.

I guess what it says on the tin. My relationship with my family has always been... difficult for me to manage. Some background, my family consists of my parents and my 3 siblings (1 older and 2 younger). When I graduated college, I moved to a major city in a different state for my job. Before that, I would see my family every 1-2 months when I would visit from college. I would have said back then that we were close, my younger siblings and I had a good bond due to large age gap that meant I spent a lot of time watching them when my parents were working.

Over the last few years, I've become somewhat of the black sheep of the family, mostly due to my liberal politics, which my mother views as a personal failing on her part. There weren't any disagreements or arguments, but plenty of comments about how I just young and would realize the error of my ways when I got older (even though I'm 26 now and nothings changed).

Ever since I was young ( early teens) i would do everything I could to make my parents lives easier, like watching my siblings after school and helping around the house with cooking and cleaning. This pattern has continued into recent years, with me spending my vacations visiting them cleaning, helping cook, and doing household projects. A part of this (and why I bring it up) is that when it comes to my family, I'm an extreme people pleaser with low boundaries.

I have been trying to establish some boundaries over the last few months, mostly in the form of not engaging with comments they make about my life and actively telling them I don't wish to discuss politics with them. One boundary I set was to reach out to them less, as I was always making time to call them and see how things are going..

I realized today that since I stopped reaching out, they've for the most part just stopped talking to me. My older sibling is the only exception, who will call/text frequently. Otherwise, i only hear from them when my older sibling initiates a group calls. For example, my mother called my older sibling today to catch up and then they promised each other there would be an evening facetime  tonight. There never was one, and my mother never reached out to see how I was doing. The realization hurts, because I genuinely love them all, I just dont have the energy to always be reaching out to them.

Reddit, can you help me get perspective? Is this just normal behavior that I shouldn't hold a grudge over? I just really

Hello there. I am writing an English paper about a subject of my choosing and I chose liquid-fuel rocket engines. My thesis is: liquid-fuel rocket engines are the most important aspect of what has brought us into the space age and is the key development that will allow us to continue to be a space exploring species. The gist of it is I need 4 sources for a works cited and to use that information to back up the info in my paper and make arguments. The topic more defined is: the importance and history of liquid-fuel rocket engines specifically and their importance in the big picture of rocket engines. I have 3 scholarly research papers I found through JSTOR and other scholarly paper search engine sites but one source needs to be from the internet (but a site that ends in .gov or .edu). I am having trouble locating a good source from the internet that is reliable and relevant. I want to talk about other types of engines (practical and theoretical) and use them to compare to the reliability and importance of the liquid-fuel engine. I have some technical info I can drawn upon from one of my sources and my other sources kind of talk about the history of the engines and the Apollo 11 landing. Since liquid-fuel engines took us to the moon and are still being used today, that’s why I think it’s so important. If anyone knows of a source that they think would be helpful that would be great. I appreciate any input. Thank you.

I am currently studying GM in my philosophy class and the professor stated that Nietzsche suggests the master and slave relationship leads to what he calls the sovereign individual. I am struggling to understand how exactly this takes place. I would very much appreciate some clarification!!

2020-11-15 06:57:00 : [BUG] Audio issues while inside Caustic Gas : Rainey-kins : https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/juht51/bug_audio_issues_while_inside_caustic_gas/

This is something I only noticed today, but primarily because I rarely play with/against a caustic. Two different times while inside friendly gas, the sounds for enemy gunshots were completely silent. This was confirmed by both of my teammates in both instances. I'm not sure if it's something I could replicate, but it's the only time I had an issue with it.  
  
**When**: While inside a Friendly Caustic Ult  
**What Happened**: Gunshot noises, both friendly and enemy go silent or sound incredibly distant  
**Where**:  
 - **1.** First time was the southern-most door leading into Turbine (Trident drove in, Horizon threw a tactical, Gibby used his shield, and then Caustic used his Ult. Afterwards, the Caustic and I couldn't hear gunfire)  
 - **2.** Second time was near the end of the ring in the top POI (depot?), but there weren't any other tacticals or abilities used, and there were only 6 players left.  
  
This has been the first time I've had such glaring audio bugs, and it comes on the heels of an audio change (iirc) as well as a small caustic gas change, so I'm assuming this is new. Anyone else experienced this?

So I am making a list. I wouldn't recommend asking why cause it would probably be longer than the completed list itself. I love to organize things into alphabetical lists with categories for categories. So right now I have the category Athropods, which has Hexapoda, Arachnids, Myriapods, and Crustaceans. Starting with the category Hexapoda, which has ants, bees, beetles, butterflies, Cockroaches, Crickets, Dragonflies, Fleas, Flies, Mantis, Mosquitos, Phasmids, and Wasps. I know there are more. I am constantly searching. Please help me find extra things to add to this master list. Eventually I will start going into each of those categories and make a list of each ant, then each bee, and so on and so forth. Thank you all.

2020-11-15 06:58:15 : Benefit to getting diagnosed? : Creature1345 : https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticPride/comments/juhtm8/benefit_to_getting_diagnosed/

Hey, I'm 17 and I think I am autistic. I have never been diagnosed with anything, but I experience a lot of anxiety, even when there is no obvious cause. I also have sensory issues (for example: right now my left arm has a slightly tickly feeling, not painful, just tickly, and it's so overwhelming I almost cried). I also tend to focus hard on one thing at a time and have a difficult time switching between things. And (this is the one that is really causing problems for me) sometimes when people ask me questions and I don't already have an answer lined up I just freeze and can't say anything or start to feel angry.

I'm not really asking if any of you think I'm right, but I am wondering if it is worth getting diagnosed? The thought that I might go up to a medical professional and tell them I think I am autistic, then they say I'm wrong--that kills me to even think about. Not because I want to be autistic or anything, just because I hate feeling like I've made a fool of myself. I haven't ever seriously looked into seeking a diagnosis, and I was wondering what are the benefits? I'm not super keen on medication or therapy (I have nothing against those thing so maybe this is just an unhealthy mindset, but I just don't want to do it) so is there any purpose to diagnosis?

2020-11-15 06:58:12 : Should I insure a letter for the total amount of money I will lose if that letter doesn't get delivered / can I sue for that amount? : Choice-Inspector-991 : https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladviceofftopic/comments/juhtli/should_i_insure_a_letter_for_the_total_amount_of/

I am currently located in China. I have applied for a job here and to get the required work permit to have permission to work I need to mail some documents (my degree certificate) to the Chinese embassy in UK for legalisation.

My degree certificate is the only one in my possession and my university is closed due to covid so I can't get another copy.

If this document should get lost the following will happen:

\- Wont be able to get my work permit

\- Will lose my job offer

\- Wont be earning $3,800 a month from that job

\- Will get kicked out of China when my current visa expires

\- Will need to buy a plane ticket totalling $800 

\- Chinese border is closed so I will be stuck in UK for an unknown number of months losing $3,800 every month

\- If the border opens I will need to pay $200 for a new visa, $200 for corona virus testing and $2000 for a plane ticket back to China. And then once in China I will need to qurenteen for 14 days at my expense totalling around $800

So my question is should I insure this package for $10,800? (this is calculated based on 2 months of lost wages, but it may be more)

I've heard of delivery companies trying to give there own value of goods in a package no matter what you insure it for. And no surprises that their evaluations of what they should pay you are way lower. They would probaly only want to pay $50 for a new certificate to be printed (which can't because my uni is closed)

The Chinese post can gaurentee they wont lose it but they wont say anything about after they give it to UK Royal Mail. So my question is can I successfully sue Royal Mail for $10,800?

Probably not right?

I don't even know if the G2 is still coming and it's probably partly my fault. I checked out as a guest, mainly because I was naively trusting of the site, and because I generally do when I don't know if I'll use a site ever again in the future.

My CC got charged and the charge was removed as expected, and I did get some sort of promotional e-mail several weeks ago about how it's "coming soon!"

And then I haven't gotten anything since. I've tried using their customer support thing online(i don't like using phones if it can be avoided) using the email i gave when purchasing, to ask if I was still set to receive one, and never got a response other than a notification that "we received your inquiry" or whatever. It's been a couple weeks. Which I can't say has ever happened before with any customer service department ever.

I have to say, as far as I'm concerned HP is the company with a history of making mediocre Wal-mart PCs and laptops for people who don't know any better, and pretty decent printers. Having heard the G1 wasn't too bad, and seeing all the improvements on the G2, along with Valve helping them out, I figured I'd give this thing a chance.

Idk what else to really add. I literally don't know what is going on with this thing anymore.

2020-11-15 06:58:17 : Question about taking communion on the hand. : osteo5511 : https://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/juhtmi/question_about_taking_communion_on_the_hand/

Is it improper to take communion on the hand? I heard from my traditional Catholic friends that it goes against Church teaching. As someone who goes to daily mass and relies on the grace of the sacraments, I would prefer to be able to continue to take communion regularly. I go to Traditional Mass once a week but, other than that, have to take communion on the hand at my Home Parish. Also, I will be moving soon for medical school to a place that doesn't even have a Traditional parish. If the communion on the hand argument is valid, this means I would essentially be cut off from the Eucharist. If it is improper to take communion on the hand, can you use a handkerchief rather than taking the Eucharist on the hand.

I'm currently running Ghosts of Saltmarsh with slight modifications to create a cohesive campaign. My players requested I take them on an adventure/story none of them had heard of so I'm taking the opportunity to FINALLY explore Sigil and the planescape setting.  


At the end of the current story they'll have to destroy a planar portal and they will be thrown into the planes and by some power or another they will awaken on the streets of Sigil very confused and lost. I plan to run a slightly modified "Dead Gods" convert to 5e but using Mrykul instead of Orcus.  


I am currently reading over the campaign setting and the adventure but I wanted to ask if anyone had an y tips or advice for me. I've been DMing for about 25 years but never in Sigil or planescape.

I have also been reading the Yoga Birth Method so I do have a few coping strategies. But being new to this I'm realizing I can't quite imagine the depth of the experience. 
    
The one support I will have is my partner, who will be there to hold my hand, literally and figuratively. But if I as the pregnant person feel unprepared, he has no inkling of what's to come. How did your partner help you? What are some good resources to look to that aren't too research-heavy that I can share with him?

Has anyone noticed that Dr. Matt seems to be teasing the ATF lately.  The week the ATF announced they were going to consider the honey badger an SBR, Dr. Matt made a video with one.  He also recently made a video where he shot the barrel off a shotgun and continued to shoot it.  We all know that he knows all of the federal laws.  I am not sure if he's trying to catch a case on purpose to be the subject of a landmark SCOTUS decision that shuts down the NFA or not, but there has to be a better method.  The path he is going down will result in an arrest, conviction, probably jail time, the loss of his 2nd amendment rights, well over a million in legal fees, years of appeals, and and outcome that isn't guaranteed.  Dr. Matt seems like a great guy who has a wonderful family, and I would hate to seem him go through it, especially if there is a better way to get legal standing.  What do you guys think about this?

Assassin's Creed Liberation was a big step for ubisoft they took a big risk making a game about such a sensitive subject. I loved it but I felt that the reason it was held back was due to it's original release on the vita. My opinion is that it's a hidden gem a lot of people complain about not being able to carry bodies or crouch but when you play it you don't really run into a situation where you need to. I however would like to see maybe a expansion on this character like a new game or something later down the line.

The world 7/10

The story 6/10 

The character 9/10 

The side quests 8/10 

Overall 6/10 

Favorite Sequences 2 and 4

The world

The main story will take place across three vastly different environments each having a unique touch and aesthetic to it. The first environment is New Orleans vastly changing over the course of the short but fun story. The bayou this was my favorite area because it took advantage of what AC:3 didn't, environmental parkour. The final environment was Chichen Itza aka Mexico though few sequences take place here it's really fun as well. The two things I disliked were that the map markers were big glowing balls and that the world sometimes not all the time but sometimes felt too empty. I really loved the feeling of being monitored by Abstergo though and the E mission/true ending.

The Character 

Aveline De Grandpre is a french african assassin who was the daughter of a slave and a rich merchant. Her goal as an assassin is to free the slaves of New Orleans and stop the spanish from invading while also hunting down the occasional piece of eden. Overall she's super badass and fun to play as her combat style which is kinda hard to learn at the beginning is super fluid and rewarding once learned. Her unique talent is that she has personas or outfits she uses to blend into her environments. Her weapons were super fun and her tools were super cool.

Story/Side Missions

To avoid spoilers which is pretty hard to do with this title I will just say that the character section covers the story pretty well it's pretty great tbh. The story can feel rushed at some points and Agates complaining gets annoying later on. But overall it's pretty great and the voice acting is pretty awesome considering when this came out and what it came out on. Some side missions however are super amazing some not so much the best ones are obviously taking down plantations and freeing slaves the not so good ones are trying to find a target in a mix of buildings and crowds within a certain amount of time.

---Cons I need to mention 

The camera can be pretty janky sometimes and it can get annoying

The control scheme isn't the best. considering it's a port it's pretty forgivable

Near impossible full synch challenges

Lack of checkpoints can make moments tedious sometimes


---What I would have changed 

Made E a side missions marker with a notification after each chapter 

Added a cutscene after Abstergo intro telling us more about Avelines story 

More interference from E and Abstergo

Different puzzle in the mines in Mexico

Faster combat and more detailed combat instead of the one we got don't get me wrong it's pretty fun but not being able to tell if we should counter or break guard when an enemy is attacking can be pretty difficult

2020-11-15 07:00:15 : Online Lotro Builder update: Relics search and Discord bot! : michaelknyazev : https://www.reddit.com/r/lotro/comments/juhued/online_lotro_builder_update_relics_search_and/

## Hello Lotro Players!

About month ago I posted my little-pet project dedicated to LOTRO on reddit, and today I want to tell you about nice update!

If you see that project for the first time, you can see additional info about it in my first reddit post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/lotro/comments/j6yrr1/online_lotro_builder/).

The biggest features from this update are:

* Relics search and Relic HBox sharing
* Discord bot with Item search integrated

You can check them out as always at [https://lotrobuild.com](https://lotrobuild.com).

**About Relics Search:**

It is the same search as Items search, but for relics. The main difference between two of them that search result for Relics is separated by Relic category (Tier1-9, Minas Morgul etc.)

**About Discord bot:**

For now, it supports only one command:

`-item &lt;Item Name&gt;`

For example, to find and link a [New Bracer from BT](https://lotrobuild.com/items/1879412070) you must enter:

`-item bracer the bloody`

It will send you back image like this:

&amp;#x200B;

[-item bracer the bloody](https://preview.redd.it/jwpf29lqqcz51.png?width=466&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90d5a1940d56280a2bf5a39a126d1d0b3ac98758)

In next update I will make available command for Relic's Search as well.

To add discord bot to your server you must navigate to LotroBuild project page and press the button &lt;Add&gt; in Discord bot widget section.

\----

I hope you will enjoy those features, and I will appreciate feedback in comments or in reddit DM's, or in-game mail to my Character at Landroval server. 

You can contact me as well in [Facebook](https://fb.me/mikebradius), [Telegram](https://t.me/michaelknyazev) or even [Instagram](https://instagram.com/michaelknyazev). 

Thanks all for your support &lt;3

2020-11-15 07:00:24 : I see a lot of hate towards 5-man premade in this sub; what can we do? : colinjang : https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/juhuhp/i_see_a_lot_of_hate_towards_5man_premade_in_this/

tl;dr down at the bottom.

Hey fellow Heroes! I'm just a player who enjoys Heroes, not a pro or anything. I love the game, I wish it got more attention, and I hope this great game continues on. I've been playing since the 2.0 update and I've been seeing a lot of posts complaining about matchmaking since then. I know it's going to be a long post, with a bit of rant. Please understand any grammatical error or awkward sentences as English is not my mother tongue.

I regularly play Unranked Draft and ARAM in 5-man premade (it's obvious that we are premade because we all have Carbot Anduin as our player icon) and... we seem to get whispers quite often about how we are 'losers' because we are playing in a 5-man premade. I mean, so much for playing with friends, isn't it?

The thing is, we get them regardless of the game's result. Be it a close game, a stomp, our win or loss. If we win, they say we are 'a bunch of tryhards' and if we lose, they will call us 'losers that can't even win in premades'. Well, I do get that it's frustrating to have teammates that don't communicate well, but I feel like that's just toxic. We usually don't take any offenses through those whispers because we do understand the frustration (we usually reply back 'sorry', 'thanks' or 'glhf on your future games'), but being on the receiving end for a while started making us wonder what we can do about it.

Do we have a high winrate? Yes, as we DO have the advantage of better communication and team comp. It helps that we have a couple ex-GM and Master players who usually give orders in game while also having better mechanics than average players. We probably lay somewhere around 60%\~75% winrate (depending on who's playing; we have about 8-9 people in the crew) and yes, we are probably a live example of 'it's harder to win against a 5-stack' and we know it. Winning is fun, and losing isn't most of the time. Thus, general players seem to think that playing as 5-stack is some sort of an unfair advantage. In some sense, that may be correct.

Well then, why don't we go play Storm League (Ranked) in 5-man premade, where grouping up with friends and actually communicating with other players is "leagal"? (lol) Hear me out on this one; every time we give it a try, [we get into a queue for 1hr+](https://imgur.com/a/XaWiRnH) and...we give up. (The search expands at 3600s, btw) We are all living in NA, by the way. I am sure Storm League at the very least tries to put your team into a match according to the highest ranked person's MMR, as we were trying to queue up for solid 4000 seconds while someone on my friend list (ranked Bronze) played 3 Storm League games in a 5 stack.

No, we don't smurf at all nor do we give shit to the players we 'stomped.' Hell, it's not even fun most of the time when we actually get to stomp on the enemy team. We want a game where we could try our best, regardless of win or loss (which is also the reason we avoid QM, as people want to play casually there). If someone on the enemy team intentionally feeds or throws (for example, constantly running into the tower), we report them and try to end the game as fast as we can. We still have games where we just get annihilated from the beginning.

But then still, people get salty over us playing in 5 stack. So here comes the question; What do you want us to do? Also, what should Blizzard do about this? Are we so much of an evil group of people that would it be better if we just left the game? I would like to hear what you guys' general thoughts are. Thanks for reading the long post and thanks again for keeping this great game going.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr:

1. I play 5 stack most of the time, Unranked/ARAM.
2. People are salty about 5 mans, and we get it.
3. Storm League is unplayable (literally) in 5 stack for higher ranked players
4. I would like to hear, what do you want us to do?

2020-11-15 07:01:04 : Partner will make a comment about me and when I ask what he means he says there’s absolutely ‘no meaning’ behind it and accuses me of ‘analysing too much.’ : ThrowRA_whitepony : https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/juhus7/partner_will_make_a_comment_about_me_and_when_i/

I will make this straight to the point. Below is a conversation that happened today:

Me: (driving the car)

Him: Wooooaaahhhh look out here comes *my name*

Me: What does that mean?

Him: Nothing

Me: Why did you say that? Usually when you say that it means I’ve done something...

Him: I didn’t mean anything by it you’re just analysing everything I say always trying to find some hidden bad meaning.

Me: No I’m not, I’m just trying to understand why you said that out of the blue because I don’t know what I did.

Him: Well you’re wrong and you’re just trying to start an argument.

Me: I’m not, I just want to understand why you made that comment. You do this a lot and whenever I question it you tell me I’m imagining things and I’m being crazy, and I’m not. People don’t just say things like that for no reason.

Him: I just thought you charged into the car park when you drove in.

Me: Okay so that’s it. There’s the reason. Why can’t you just say that instead of denying it and making me feel crazy??

Him: It was an off the cuff statement with no meaning or thought behind it until you just made me sit and question it. I feel too scared to ever say something because you just analyse me.

Me: I’m not trying to do that, I just simply asked what you meant and now I know the reason. This is an important issue to me that I really want to try and resolve because it makes me feel crazy when you pretend you have no idea what I’m talking about when you say comments like this.

Him: This whole discussion is stupid and doesn’t deserve any time. This is ridiculous.


So yeah, basically this kind of interaction will happen on a pretty regular basis. My partner is very much someone who speaks without thinking and is very blunt/struggles to understand a lot of the time how something HE has said or done could possibly upset or offend me.

He feels as though he isn’t free to ‘just say his opinion’ without me ‘flying off the handle’ and I feel as though he just shouldn’t behave that way in the first place. 

We have been to counselling already. He seems to understand during the session but that completely goes out the window in practice. He will bring up things we have learnt during our sessions that solely benefit him (such as ‘Counsellor said that when things get too emotional you need a time out so I think you’re just being emotional and irrational now and blowing this out of proportion and getting really mad over something tiny’ ..... AHHHHHHH?


I’m really lost as to where to go from here. This is an ongoing issue that I have tried to communicate and sort out multiple times with no success. He just doesn’t understand where I’m coming from AT ALL. He won’t admit to saying comments and denying there’s very obviously a reason for making them. It drives me absolutely insane. It’s like he just says it without thinking then when I pull him up on it he internally thinks ‘oh shit, better cover this up so she doesn’t get mad’ BUT THAT’S WHAT MAKES ME MAD!!! Advice???

I made it another week without messaging you, I don't know how. I'm a mess. This week was awful, and all I wanted was you. Every day I thought I was going to break. I saw that you came back to social to post a song, and then you deactivated. I wanted to like it, but I wanted to give you space. I'm not sure if that was a test and if it was, did I fail, Strawberry? I look for you every day, and then yesterday I saw you. I felt better seeing you there. I loved the song you posted. I don't want to be there without you anymore.   


I wanted to tell you about my bad dream, about the person I told to go away for good, and how scared I was that I was going to lose my cat, that I won't be going to my mom's for Christmas, that we're on stay home orders again. I wanted to know where you had hiked, what beautiful things you saw, and ask how your application for school is going. I hope you're still going to apply. I hope you are healing. I hope you are okay.

2020-11-15 07:01:24 : Since this is the smartest subreddit in gaming, can you guys solve JREG : farasapt : https://www.reddit.com/r/GameTheorists/comments/juhux4/since_this_is_the_smartest_subreddit_in_gaming/

I'm gonna stretch this topic as a game theory since MattPatt had stretch a few topic and labels it as a 'Game Theory' before so I feel this fit the bill. Can you guys solve JREG?

Jreg (Greg Guevara) is a Canadian political satirist, spoken word poet, and singer/songwriter. He is well known for his anticentrist videos and personification of the four quadrants of the political compass, all featured in his series Centricide. In his most prominent video series as of now, Centricide Season 1, he tells the tale of the Anti-Centrist (aka himself) trying to unite all the extremes to fight the Centrist Plague.

Here's are characters that he played in his videos, adopting the ideologies as his own, questioning the status quo. Some are real ideologies while others are quirky random funny yet wacky dangerous ideologies.

I just finished Valhalla and am wondering, where or what happened to the unnamed protagonist we were playing as in 4 through rouge (And maybe unity and syndicate) I know this may be a dumb question for some people but it’s weird how we were playing as Desmond for the whole main Ezio trilogy and Connor to his death and altair and layla with origins through Valhalla to her death and we see the end of both there story’s but we never see the ending to the guy we played as in rouge. Like I said it’s probably answered and I’m just babbling out random already answered questions but I’m really wondering 

(P.S I’m on mobile and suck at sentences so a lot of them are run on sorry)

2020-11-15 07:02:36 : 25 [M4F] - Hello there from your Russian friend! : sanek94cool : https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/juhvf7/25_m4f_hello_there_from_your_russian_friend/

 

Aaaand just imagine I will be saying "Hello there" with the best Ewan Mccgregor impression!

My  name is Alex. I have come from Volgograd area, Russia to US around 7  years ago and now live in Portland, OR. This was a huge leap to unknown  for me and was probably the most important decision on my life.

It  wasn't an easy thing (and it is still not), but it allowed to build  myself from ground up, get a decent education and find a job that I  really enjoy. This was all thanks to the bravery of my mother who took  me and I forever greatful to her for this.

Besides  that, this literally collided two perspectives in my mind (cultural  shock at 18 yo is real!). Even without political misunderstanding the  western and russian world have different mentalities. Not saying that I  took the best from each, but I think I can say it allowed me to build up  a unique perspective that you might be interested to know about :)

Sooo, these are the things I like:

\-  From the hint on top you probably guessed already that I love Star  Wars. So I can say that yes, I love prequels (in Soviet Russia you start  watching them in chronological order! Srsly). And I love The Clone Wars  TW show that I personally consider THE best Star Wars out there. It is a  huge part of my adolescence.

\- I  love video games, but I have figured that I am getting more interested  on how to MAKE them. I don't even play as much as I dive in Unreal  Engine 4 and figure how to make cinematic shots with 3D models of mine!  This is really so fun! That's my personal Holly Grail of 2020 that keeps  me sane and because of it I have a right to tell that year was  productive for me.

\- I love decent  anime (screw harem garbage, all hail FMA and AOT!), movies (Nolan is  genius! like Kojima ;D) and various music (except rap, just... no). I  will make a cultural sharing with you, because I bet you never heard of  awesome "Slavic Folklore meets Drumm&amp;Bass"!

\-  I love cooking. Boy, I really enjoy it! Never thought about how cool it  is until I got to college, which eventually forced me to learn it, cuz  you gotta survive somehow :D

\- I  am introvert and usually enjoy the company of my own. That doesn't mean  that I do not enjoy a company of wholesome people that enjoy my company  as well, I just don't do it that often.

\-  I love my family. The time and some tragic events have taught and  reminded me that we all mortal, become weak and eventually fade away.  Because of that I have relearned (and still do) on how to appreciate  those who care about your whole life and also to don't give out the  energy for those who just want your attention, but not your personality  or soul.

I  do not expect much from this post. But I have a feeling that with that  kind of attitude I should make it and LET IT GOOOO... sorry :D

If you are interested, let's chat! Always eager to know decent people!

PS, that's me - [https://sun9-33.userapi.com/c824604/v824604577/159e50/rwFRkXFfFtU.jpg](https://sun9-33.userapi.com/c824604/v824604577/159e50/rwFRkXFfFtU.jpg)

2020-11-15 07:02:29 : Texted my ex happy birthday, got more of a response than what I wanted/expected : BountifulLoot : https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/juhvd5/texted_my_ex_happy_birthday_got_more_of_a/

My ex and I broke up back in February of this year. We had been best friends since high school and dated for 5 years. A combination of long distance and growing apart/lack of compatibility on big stuff ended the relationship.  He is the one who ended things. It was tough initially, but we went no-contact/low contact starting in May (he also initiated this). He wished me happy birthday in July. A few weeks later, he said he was open to resuming contact, but I told him I needed more time in order to be friends. He reached out again once more, and I told him the same thing.

While I am dealing with some mental health issues due to all of the craziness of this year, I still felt better off not really engaging with my ex. We were each other’s best friends, but I often spend way too much time worrying about him and his life decisions when we’re together. I just don’t know if I can handle that anxiety right now...

Nonetheless, his birthday was coming up and I felt anxious on whether to not contact him or to return the “happy birthday” pleasantries. Let him know someone is thinking of him since he often feels alone. On his birthday, I ended up deciding to send a brief happy birthday message. I wanted it to be a brief exchange and that was that, but he has since tried to drag out the conversation and try to catch up. 

I’m pretty sure he wants to rekindle a close friendship again, but I still don’t want that right now (and I honestly don’t know if I’ll ever be ready for it). I just wanted to return kindness, since he extended towards me. Also, I started dating someone a month ago and don’t want to deal with the messiness of “rekindling a friendship with an ex”. 

Part of me feels terrible for contacting him now, but I also would’ve felt terrible not wishing him happy birthday (especially since we didn’t end on bad terms). Should I just tell him, “it’s been great catching up, but I don’t want to continue this conversation any further?”

I have in the past, when desperately needing professional help, been using and abusing pain killers and other sedating drugs, just to get through the day. I never touch alcohol, as it severely impacts my mental health immediately after consumed, and after that for weeks, worsening and deepening my depression while spiking my anxiety. Recently i got myself into a bad habit with benzodiazepines, as regular doctors are unsure of what to do with me. The reason for this is that i have a heart condition that makes all modern anti anxiety medication a hassle for me to use, since i keep getting severe palpations when used, thus worsening my anxiety and stressing me out. I've used thousands of dollars on private clinic doctors, but they all remain in the standard area when it comes to medicine. 

The point of my post would be, is there anyone out there,  or someone that knows one, that has been in a similar position as i am in right now? Because i need some advice / guidance as to where i go from here. I'm open to find/try unusal medicines/ herbs that can give me some mental relief so i can function better, and make my life a little better. Any comments/help or advice would be appreciated.. i should note that i've been a very physical fit person for the most of my life, but recently have gained alot of weight due to my illness making me unable to workout on the level i used to.

I now have three notifications that will never go away because I posted on the Unus Annus subreddit before it closed and three people commented.
my post said something along the lines of "This is the first and only post I've made and ever will make on the Unus Annus subreddit, better make it good: Fuck" and it got like 80 upvotes when I last checked it. For all I know it could have gotten a billion but now this is a semi-permanent reminder of the subreddit. But of course that could go away for any reason not within my power, too. Such is the purpose of Unus Annus.

2020-11-15 07:02:56 : A pure democratixally planned economy can be more efficient than a market economy by focusing resources on specific goals : NovaSwarm : https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/juhvjr/a_pure_democratixally_planned_economy_can_be_more/




----

Focusing:

A planned economy can be made up of a small set of large scale multidecade or multicentury projects and programs geared towards specific goals. Goals such as curing or preventing certain major causes of death(including aging) or extreme suffering, goals such as creating an artificial general intelligence for forecasting and invention.

All resource allocation can be made with this goal in mind rather than merely to match supply with demand.



Sharing: Sharing comes in various forms. In most of these forms they create efficiencies by reducing costs to individual participants and reducing duplicate costs at the macro level.

Individual workers can get some of the consumer goods they personally want through shared DIY manufacturing facilities, [refill supply vehicles](https://youtu.be/ixBbRJVFlcg) and libraries which lend out more than just books, but also consumer items, art and devices.





----

Mind you, I am in support of monetary systems, I think money can be used better if money creation was controlled through direct democracy and multistakeholderism. That said, for the sake of discussion I will assume the absence of money. I like money to be an enhancement to an already efficient system, not a crutch for an inefficient one

It would be great if they would add some modes from workshop to the console version. Stick it right in the extra modes section. (It’s time for some anyways) 

Would love to try out the maps where you fly through the hoops.

Like the title says. I know that the main common denominator in successfully transferring to a top university is having an extremely high college GPA. But those who did get 3.9+ during college and possibly got rejected to certain schools, what do you think is the main flaw in your application? I’m currently aiming for top 20-30 schools.

2020-11-15 07:03:34 : A couple of issues i need advice on : Pascal543 : https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/juhvsp/a_couple_of_issues_i_need_advice_on/

I am a male of 21 years. Weight 61 kg, height 5' 11"
I am right now in Saudi Arabia and usually live in India. Don't smoke nor drink. I take cetrizine for my allergies and use topical steriods for my eczema

To start with i have eczema almost covering most of my body. I also have had vitamin D deficiency over time but i haven't gotten it checked since the tests were very expensive where i was currently at (away from where i usually live due to covid). These are the following issues i have that have been persistant over very long time and would like some advice.

1. The base of my both feets are always in pain, this is more particular in my left leg than my right one but both of them have always been in pain.
My doctor said it might be due to eczema but even after clearing it up with heavy medications,  the pain didnt go away so i was recommended physio therapy since i also had hand tremors and they thought it was due to spine thing, physio therapy cured my tremors but my leg pain still persisted. I do exercises and stretching and it all doesnt help. The only time i get relieved  is either through massage or tying it tightly with a cloth ( basically pressing it with a cloth)

2. Recently my left upper thigh muscles, right arm muscles and left eye have been constantly twitching on and off randomly. Along with random pain in my left lower abdomen.  Again completely random.  And by recently i mean about 6 months or so
The leg pain however has been with me for atleast 2 years.

So i was wondering if to show a doctor right now is necessary or i could wait for a couple of months until i returned home
Also what might be the cause of my leg pain. 
Thanks.

They like me, I want them to love me like they love 'Pac

But holla in New York them niggas'll tell ya I'm loco
And the plan is to put the rap game in a choke hold

2020-11-15 07:04:30 : The Cruise : RoseBlack2222 : https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/juhw4v/the_cruise/

Something happened to me six months ago that I need to get off my chest. You see I used to be a fisherman of sorts. I didn't do it for a living. It was more for recreation than anything else. After what else I saw, however, I won't go back out to sea for as long as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

It began like all my other trips. I got in my boat and rode it towards my usual spot. There, I could fish uninterrupted without hearing the obnoxious sound of teenagers on boats. Not to mention, other fishermen or those yuppie assholes on their yachts.  Anyway, it wasn't long into my trip when the weather started changing.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

It looked as though a storm was brewing up. Obviously, this worried me. I always made sure to check the weather before heading out. It said absolutely nothing about a storm in the area. Realizing this, I proceeded to head back to shore. Unfortunately, fate had other plans.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

"God damn it,” I said to myself while attempting to steer the boat towards the shore.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As I did a huge wave kicked up. The next thing I knew, my boat got overturned and I found myself underwater. I tried staying above water. With the waves being so rough, though it didn’t seem like I’d be able to for very long. What I thought was my saving grace appeared over the waves.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Through the flashes of lighting, I saw it. A massive ship came over the roaring waves. It looked to be some kind of cruise ship.  I yelled as loud as I could for them to notice me. They threw me a life preserve which I eagerly grabbed hold of. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

“He seems delirious. Get him a towel.”

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

It’s difficult to describe the voice I heard. It definitely sounded English. However, it didn’t sound organic. It was like hearing someone American do a really good imitation of that accent. I brushed off this abnormality and thanked my saviors.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

“Oh, man. I thought I was a goner,” I said, rubbing the water from my eyes. “Thanks for the help.”

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The blurriness went away, allowing me to see who I presumed to be the captain, judging by his outfit colored a bright gold. Standing beside him were two of his crewmates. I had been led inside the ship to a guest room. Only the captain talked with me while they remained silent.

&amp;#x200B;

“It’s not a problem,” he smiled.  “But to whom do I owe this pleasure to?”

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

He was a tall man. I’d say, he stood at about 7”.  He had perfectly combed blonde hair and bright golden eyes that lit up when he smiled.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

“Cody. What should I call you?”

&amp;#x200B;

“Most just call me captain but you may refer to me as Rupin. Now, would you mind explaining why you were out here in the midst of such harsh weather?”

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I leaned back against the wall and briefly summarized my reason for being out there.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

“I see. That’s a real shame. It’s to be expected, though. I’ve spent many years on the sea and I can tell you that it’s full of surprises. A lot of which aren’t pleasant. Anyway, I imagine you’re quite chilly. Would you like something to warm you up? The guests are getting ready to dine right now.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Thank you but aren’t we close to shore? It isn’t a long walk from there to my car and I’d hate to intrude.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Not to worry. You aren’t overstaying your welcome if that’s what you’re thinking. Besides, the weather’s still too rough for us to go anywhere. We’re anchored down right now, but once the weather is clear, we’ll pull the anchor up and head back to shore to drop you off at the doc.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Okay. It can’t be helped I guess. It’s weird, though. I was at the docs pretty early and I don’t recall seeing you guys pull up there.”

&amp;#x200B;

“It must not have been on our route then.”

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

He glanced at his watch.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

“Sorry to cut this short but there are other matters on the ship that require my attention.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Alright. Do you mind if I explore the ship?”

&amp;#x200B;

“I’d prefer you didn’t. Some parts of the ship can be hazardous..”

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

He then tossed me a key with the number ten imprinted into it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

“What’s this for?” 

&amp;#x200B;

“It’s to this room in case you decide to stay a little longer. We wouldn’t mind if you do. The more the merrier, as they say. Come upstairs when you’re ready to sit with us.”

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

He then turned and began walking away along with his crew members. Although I couldn’t explain it at the time, part of what he said rubbed me the wrong way. I ignored this oddity. Then got dressed. The clothes I put on felt wrong somehow in a way I couldn’t explain.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

After the adrenaline of my near-drowning wore off, I had worked up quite the appetite. I proceeded to make my way there when someone got my attention. I felt someone grab my wrist. I jumped and looked back to see a distressed-looking man. He had the appearance of someone not of sound mind yet hiding it because he’s afraid of what’ll happen to him if he doesn’t.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

“You said your name’s Cody, right?” He asked in a gruff voice.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

From his uniform, I could tell he must be a grunt worker, the kind who does a lot of heavy lifting. His grip tightened on my arm. The way he looked unnerved me.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

“Yeah...Do you need something?” I asked, trying to keep from sounding nervous.

&amp;#x200B;

“I wanted to warn you before it’s too late. Leave this ship and don’t look back.”

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

His words puzzled me.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

“Why?”

&amp;#x200B;

“This place ain’t what it seems.”

&amp;#x200B;

“What does that mean?”

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

He shook his head.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

“I don’t have time to give you the full story. I need to get back to work before they realize I’m gone. All I can say is that this ship appears different to each person. If you value your life and freedom you’ll heed my advice.”

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My first thought upon hearing this was that this guy did not have it all together mentally. The next one that entered my head involved all the horror movies I’ve seen. In particular, I thought about the ones where someone tries to warn others about danger but nobody listens. This wasn’t a movie though, this was real life. Still, I figured I should at least inquire about some things from the man.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

“Thanks. I’ll keep that in mind. Let’s say I needed to make it to a lifeboat, though. Where would I find one?”

&amp;#x200B;

“The promenade deck. It’s near the font of the ship. Now if you’ll excuse me.”

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

He turned and began walking away. Then paused and looked back.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

“Oh yeah.  I almost forgot. Don’t eat or drink anything here and don’t dance.”

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

With that, he continued down the hall and eventually left my sight. I spent a moment considering what he said. The ship appearing suddenly in the midst of the storm certainly did seem odd. However, as I said the weather was too dangerous for me to leave at the time. Besides that, I didn’t really feel as though I was in any sort of immediate danger so I headed to the dining room.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The brightness of it caused me to squint my eyes. Chandeliers hung from the ceiling. For some reason, I couldn’t help but get an uneasy feeling from looking at them. The way they swayed back and forth reminded me of something I couldn’t quite put my finger on. I remembered what the man had said and wondered what he saw whenever he went into the dining room.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

“Cody.”

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Rupin saying my name, snapped me out of my thoughts. He sat at a table. With him were people dressed in clothes that I guessed were pretty expensive. I’ll admit I’m not exactly the most eloquent person when it comes to social gatherings. Nonetheless, I tried to behave as best I could when I’m in those kinds of situations.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

“Have a seat.”

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

A chair near the captain was pulled out for me. It felt really comfortable to sit in. Again, though I felt that something was off.  I monetarily forgot about this when the banquet got out in front of us. Mouthwatering doesn’t begin to describe this food. I swear I could hear angelic singing and see a golden aura around the food as they set it out.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

While they did I looked around in order to see who else was seated at the other tables. The diners were very diverse. They included people of all races. This didn’t strike me as unusual until they began speaking with each other. All of them spoke in different languages which told me they were from different regions.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

“Rupin?” I said.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

He was busy chatting with someone about some music he hadn’t heard in a while. I think he mentioned it being from a Chinese play. He paused and faced me.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

“Yes, Cody. Is there something I can help you with?”

&amp;#x200B;

“I just noticed that a lot of the people here seem to be from different countries. Would you mind telling me exactly how they came to be on this ship?’

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I thought I saw a hint of annoyance come over him before it vanished as quickly as it came. He smiled and responded to my question.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

“Well, you see, this cruise is very exclusive. Only a select few know about it and they come from all over in order to attend it.”

&amp;#x200B;

“It must be pretty expensive I imagine.”

&amp;#x200B;

“You’d be correct on that. As our motto on this ship says though, happiness is worth the price. Now, why don’t you enjoy some of this food?”

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I was about to when I remembered what the man had said but didn’t understand why I shouldn’t eat the food. It seemed fine to me and yet I couldn’t shake off this uneasy feeling.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

“Is there something wrong?” Rupin frowned.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

He stared at me and so did everyone else at the table. This caused me to become nervous.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

“Sorry. It’s just that I’m still a little shaken up about what happened. I don’t really have an appetite right now,” I replied to him.

&amp;#x200B;

“Ah. I see. No rush then. It’s not as if the food is going anywhere,” he chuckled. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

What I said hadn’t been entirely true. Although I was indeed shaken up, my appetite had skyrocketed at the sight of the food. I wanted so badly to satisfy my ravenous appetite yet something wouldn’t permit me to. It felt as if some kind of instinct was preventing me from indulging in the food.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

“Why don’t I want to eat any of this food?” I wondered. “Maybe it’s just the situation. After all, I’ve never been on a cruise before. Yeah, that must be it.”

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I grabbed a fork and was about to eat my meal which was lobster dinner.  The lobster sounded off. What do I mean by that?  Well, you know how when you eat lobster it cracks open?  It did. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

However, it almost sounded as though the cracking was coming from somewhere else. The best way I can think to explain it is you ever watch a video where the sound isn’t quite in sync? It’s kind of like that. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

“Am I going crazy?” I thought.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I hoped that nobody took notice of my nervousness. I couldn’t help it. When I thought of all the events that occurred starting with the storm, nothing added up. The weather had been clear save for some clouds. Then suddenly a huge storm appeared out of nowhere.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I was sitting in a dining room with people of varying nationalities. These people, I should remind you apparently traveled across the world just to attend the cruise. One which Rupin told me is really exclusive and not many people know about. Once again my mind flashed back to what the man said. If it was true and he wasn't delusional then what is the ship's true appearance?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

These thoughts among others bounced around in my head. Then I got an idea. I turned back to Rupin. He was enjoying some wine and calamari. He took notice of me looking at him.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

"Is there something you need, Cody?"

&amp;#x200B;

"Would you mind if I talked with some of the other passengers? I figured with people of so many nationalities here, it'd be a good opportunity to learn more about different cultures."

&amp;#x200B;

"That's an excellent idea. As a matter of fact, I’ve always been of the belief that the best way to learn about one’s culture is through their music.”

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Rupin stood up from his seat. Nobody asked him where he was going so I inquired about it. He smiled again while straightening his jacket.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

“I’m going to play for everyone.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Really?”

&amp;#x200B;

“Oh yes. During my travels, I’ve been fortunate enough to hear the works of musicians from all over and have become a bit of one myself.”

&amp;#x200B;

“What kind of music can you play?”

&amp;#x200B;

“You’re about to find out.”

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Talented didn't begin to describe Rupin’s musical ability. The best way I can describe it is, angelic. Despite the fact, all of the songs he performed were in languages I couldn’t understand, I felt so relaxed while listening to him. Then I got a feeling similar to how I felt while looking at the food. Even though I wanted to tap my foot rhythmically to Rupin music, my body wouldn’t let me.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

“This is the second time I’ve gotten this feeling. What the hell is going on?” I thought.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I looked around the room again to observe the other patrons. They had this weird gleam in their eyes. It looked to me as if they were in some kind of trance. I know this isn’t too unusual for say, a  concert. It’s easy for people to get swept up in good music.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

However, what unnerved me is the fact they were able to sing along with him the lyrics of every song. I don’t mean it like they just mouthed the words either. I distinctly remember hearing them sing in sync with him. That caused a knot to start forming in my stomach. If it was just one or two songs I wouldn’t have noticed it, but many were sung, and they all sang to them perfectly.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

“How long have these people been here?” I asked myself.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I also wondered how long they’d need to have been there to learn the lyrics of every song. Granted, it probably wouldn’t be too difficult for the people who understood the lyrics. The peculiarity is with the fact these people who as far as I could tell didn’t speak multiple languages, knew them inside and out. I  got a strong feeling I should leave the dining room. Then get to one of the lifeboats and use it to get away from the ship.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I didn’t want to just abruptly stand up and leave due to my fear of drawing attention to myself. While everyone allowed themselves to get wrapped up in it, I took the opportunity to slip away. I remembered where the man had told me the lifeboats were kept and headed there or at least that’s what I planned on doing. Much to my dismay, though I found that the doors leading to the outer deck were locked. I cursed and frantically pushed on them in hopes that they would somehow come open.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

When that didn’t work I thought my next course of action would be to find that man again. He had insisted that I get off the ship. I figured he might have some keys to the door or a way to get outside. In case you’re wondering, I did try some windows. Unfortunately, they were also locked and not made out of regular glass which caused my efforts of breaking them to be futile.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I went back downstairs to search for him. I didn’t see him at first. That changed when I went further down the hall. I saw a door that was ajar. I went through it. At first, it just appeared to be a storage room. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Crates were stacked against the wall. Nothing seemed out of place there until I heard a noise. It was a rhythmic hum. Curious, I followed it and my mouth fell open when I saw its source. I found a large hole between the crates.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The edges of it were jagged, almost resembling teeth. A purple light shone from it that almost seemed to pulse. I found something mesmerizing about it, as though finding what made it would reveal some hidden truth. Apprehension caused me to be hesitant about going into it. I got over this, figuring that if I wanted to leave I’d have to take my chances with it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Going into the hole, took me to a corridor. I felt air on me coming from vents. The more I walked through it, the less it felt like air coming out of the vents, and the more it felt like some enormous creature was breathing on me. Sweat began to drip down my face. I knew that I needed to find the man as soon as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

“What is this place?” I murmured.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The walk down the corridor felt unusually long. I thought I’d never find anyone until I heard the sound of heavy objects being moved. At last, I spotted the man moving something. Creates weren’t things he moved. Instead, what he moved seemed to be large burlap sacs.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

“Hey,” I whispered to him, prompting him to run around.

&amp;#x200B;

“You,” he said in a matter of fact tone.

&amp;#x200B;

“What is this place really and can you help me get out of here?”

&amp;#x200B;

“To answer your first question, I’m not sure. To answer your second, I can.”

&amp;#x200B;

“You have a key to unlock the doors then?”

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

He shook his head.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

“I’m afraid not but I know another way out. Follow me. Whatever you do, though don’t touch the engine.”

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

He led me further down.  Pained groans echoed throughout the area.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

“What is that?”  I nervously asked.

&amp;#x200B;

“Just ignore them. You don’t want them to find you here especially when they’re hungry.”

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I said nothing as we walked. The purple light faded and lit up again in repetition. The area housed many doors. Shadows spilled under them that were only vaguely humanoid in appearance. From what I could see, the shapes had characteristics of arachnid and deep-sea creatures. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I tried holding my breath as we moved along, out of fear it would somehow draw their attention to me. The man didn’t seem bothered, as if he’d been on the ship too long to care. The air in that area had an alien taste to it. I can’t really explain it fully. The best way I can is, imagine the salty taste of the sea with a metallic hint to it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

“We’re almost there,” the man informed me.

&amp;#x200B;

“Why are you going out of your way to help me anyway?” I whispered in response.

&amp;#x200B;

“I’ve been on this ship long before you were born. It’s not a fate I’d wish on m anyone.”

&amp;#x200B;

“How old are you exactly?”

&amp;#x200B;

“I can’t really tell you that. After a while here you tend to lose your sense of time. All I can say is that I came to be here during the 1800s.”

&amp;#x200B;

“The...1800s?”

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My voice was hoarse as I spoke the words. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

“Aye. I used to be a man of the Navy. One day a storm came along and destroyed our ship. Only I survived. I would’ve drowned if Rupin hadn't come along. Honestly, that would’ve been preferable.”

&amp;#x200B;

“What’s wrong with this place?”

&amp;#x200B;

“The less you know of it, the better.”

&amp;#x200B;

At last, we arrived at the engine room. The way it sounded had an eerie similarity to a heartbeat.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

“Alright. Do you see that vent over there?”

&amp;#x200B;

“Yeah.” 

&amp;#x200B;

“Crawling through it will lead you outside. You can handle the rest from there.”

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

He opened it for me.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

“Why don’t go through them?”

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

He gave me a weak grin.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

“I’ve been here too long. Now go.”

&amp;#x200B;

“And why would he want to do that, Frank?”

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Rupin's voice echoed throughout the room. Frank, whose name I only learned about then became pale with worry. Parts of the room began twisting and warping until they formed openings. From them emerged Rupin along with some of his crewmates. He smiled yet his golden eyes flared as though a fiery rage burned inside him.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

“Run, Cody,” Frank shouted.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I attempted to jump into the vent. As I did,  I felt someone pull me back and throw me to the floor hard. Rupin grinned down at me so wide I wondered how his face didn’t split open. Some of his crewmates blocked the exits.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

“Cody, I’m disappointed in you. I saved your life and you repay me by attempting an Irish goodbye?”

&amp;#x200B;

“You aren’t human. Are you?” I replied with a stutter

&amp;#x200B;

“Whatever gave that away?” Rupin smirked.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

He turned to Frank who had been grabbed by his other crewmates.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

"Frank," he tisked. “Must we go through this again? I thought for sure after last time, you learned your lesson. I guess our reeducating wasn’t as effective as we thought. No matter, I have a new song I’ve been meaning to share with you.”

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Frank struggled futility to get free.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

“No, don’t,” he begged.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Rupin took a deep breath. Although the effect of his song will no doubt haunt me for the rest of my life and possibly long after I can’t recite it here. The reason I can’t is due to the fact the language he sang in could not possibly be spoken by human lips. My mind outright refuses to recall even one lyric of his song. All I can remember of it is that it sounded like some enormous and ancient beast was singing it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Bloody tears began streaming down Frank’s face. Rupin’s crewmates were no longer holding him. It seemed as though Rupin’s singing had put him under some kind of trance. He moaned and his body convulsed akin to someone having a seizure. My vision started doubling as I continued listening to the song.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I felt weak and needed to lean on the wall for support. Rupin turned and faced me.  His appearance had changed. His eyes were brighter and his teeth had become pointed. I stumbled forward and threw my arms out to catch myself. I ended up touching the engine.

&amp;#x200B;

When I did, a white-hot shocking pain shot through my arms. I cried out and stumbled back. The room changed again. The area seemed to melt away, revealing walls of golden flesh. The walls were covered in multi-shaped eyes that flashed with various pulsing colors.

&amp;#x200B;

"Cody, you should've been more careful. You touched my heart."

&amp;#x200B;

"Your heart?"

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I looked at the engine and saw that it had changed into a giant pulsing heart. It glowed with that same purple light I saw earlier.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

“I hope you don’t mind the changes your clothes have taken on as well.”

&amp;#x200B;

“What?”

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I glanced down at myself. To my horror, the clothes that Rupin gave to me were now made of human skin. I screamed and tugged at them frantically to remove them. Rupin laughed as I did.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

“You’re fucking sick,” I yelled at him which he only rolled his eyes at.

&amp;#x200B;

“That’s a trait of humans I’ve always despised. You all think you’re the sole arbiters of morality. I know it can't be helped, though. Your short life spans and weak minds are to blame but enough of that. You have bigger things to worry about such as, how the others have changed.”

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

He pointed to his crewmates and frank. Where they once stood were humanoid hybrids of arachnids and sea creatures. The only thing human about them were their eyes.  They were filled with so much pain and Frank now smiled. When Rupin stopped, they stood motionless with terrified smiles still on their faces.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

“What the hell are you?” I asked Rupin.

&amp;#x200B;

“Isn’t that the million-dollar question?” He laughed. “I’ll be happy to fill you in once you’re part of my crew. What I will tell you to satisfy some of your curiosity is that back home, I’m known as “The Entertainer”. Now, are you going to join us willingly? I really hate to use force. I just don’t see it as being very sportsmanlike.” 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I waited a moment before replying.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

“What does joining you entail?”

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Rupin perked up more at that.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

“Well, all you have to do is either dance to my music or consume my food.  If you do this, you’ll be under my control. However, you’ll also spend eternity and beyond as part of my audience. You’ll enjoy yourself in ignorant bliss. That is if you don’t try to struggle. If you do, you’ll end up like Frank there. You’ll work to maintain my body. I’ll only allow you fleeting moments of free will just so you can always re-experience the pain of having it taken away.  Now that you know all this, what will you choose?”

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I thought for a moment.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

“Since I don’t want to be stuck down here forever I’ll eat something in order to stay on the upper decks.”

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Rupin grinned brightly.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

“Excellent. I’ll provide that to you right away.”

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

He then turned to the others and ordered them to bring me something from upstairs. Little did he know I had swiped a knife from upstairs and put it in my pocket.  While his attention was diverted I pulled it out. It too had changed.  What was once a piece of dazzling silverware was now a worm-like creature with a sharpened bone sticking out of it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My stomach wretched as it squirmed slightly in my hand. I  did my best to ignore this as Rupin turned back to me. When he did, I brought up my weapon and stabbed it into his eye, causing a wet plopping sound.  He stumbled back and started howling with laughter. To my horror, it hadn’t hurt him in the slightest.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

“Cody, did you honestly think you’re the first person to try something like this?”

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

He pulled the thing from his eye. An empty socket with blood dripping from it looked back at me. Rupin took out a handkerchief from his coat and wiped the blood away from his eye socket with it. When he put it away, I saw that a new eye had grown in place of the one I stabbed out. At that moment, I thought I was done for.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My knees felt weak at the prospect of being enslaved on that ship. Rupin ordered that I be grabbed and taken to the upper deck. As the others started walking towards me, I searched desperately for some way to escape. At that moment, fortune smiled upon me. A massive wave hit the side of the ship.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This resulted in everyone losing their balance. Prior to that, some crew members were blocking the vent. I did not waste a second in getting back to my feet as the ship rocked back and forth. I leaped towards it. Luckily I managed to grab hold of it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

“No,” Rupin yelled. “After him.”

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

His voice took on the same warped quality as that song I mentioned. Due to the ship leaning towards one side I slid through the vent with ease. I made it to the outer deck that had also changed. It had become coated in coarse golden fur. I dashed toward where Frank mentioned the lifeboats were. Oddly enough, they looked pretty normal aside from the fact I could see them breathing.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I started towards one. Before I could reach it, the floor in front of me started rippling. From it, Rupin rose. He smiled wide yet his eyes conveyed an intense rage. His crewmates and Franklin appeared on the outer deck in the same way as he did.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

“Shit, “ I said, distraught I had come so close to escaping only for it to be ripped away from me.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Rupin made a shrill clicking noise. In response to that, the others started to shamble in my direction. Their eyes told me they wanted me to help them. I really wish I could have. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

"Cody, even among my kind I'm considered a god. Do you really think you have any chance of escape?"

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

He started singing in that haunting language again. Out of reflex, I brought my hands up to cover my ears. Despite that, I could still hear Rupin. Once again my vision started getting blurry. His claims of being a god were not hyperbolic.

&amp;#x200B;

The weather raged around us. It became even more intense than when it overturned my boat. In that instant, I realized that Rupin was the one responsible for the storm in the first place. My legs threatened to collapse under me at any time. On the verge of passing out, I mentally said my prayers until once again I got lucky.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

That's the understatement of the century. I glanced back at the ocean. It was so I could take in what I thought would be my last bit of true freedom. Among the roaring waves, I saw it. My boat rocked back and forth by some miracle not turning over and becoming lost to the ocean.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I couldn't believe it. Rupin couldn’t see the boat from where he stood. However, he did notice my change of expression. He made a shrill clicking noise The others returned it and ran at me.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Using the last of my strength, I hoisted myself over the railing. The shocking coldness I felt upon going into the water below removed the fatigue I had been previously experiencing.  I swam towards my boat as Rupin started yelling. I thought for sure he’d order his crewmates to jump after me. Instead, I was able to reach my boat and luckily it started right up.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I can’t describe how much more revolting the water caused the skin suit I had on to feel. I desperately wanted to remove it right then and there but my main priority was getting away from the ship. Then getting back to land afterward. As I rode away I glanced back at the cruise ship. What I saw when I did made my breath stop.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Had it not been for a fog coincidentally appearing to partially obscure my vision from it, I would not be coherent enough to type this up. Among the fog, the ship loomed. By now, I’m sure you can tell it wasn’t really a ship at all. However, I've still referred to it as such for the sake of convenience. Golden fur covered it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The eyes I mentioned before were also on the outside of it. There were too many to count. All of them glared down at me. Rupin did as well from the railing, only for a second. His smile returned brighter than ever.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

“It’s a real shame you’re leaving, Cody,” he called out. “You don't need to worry, though. I’ll be sure to keep in touch.”

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Rupin made a noise akin to static. My mouth jaw dropped at what happened next. Feathery rainbow-colored wings emerged from the ship. With one flap of its wings, a colossal wave got sent towards my boat. My efforts to get away from it were fruitless. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The last thing I saw before everything went black is the ship ascending to the sky and disappearing into a brilliant flash of light. I came to some time later in a hospital. Apparently, I had crashed back to shore. In the process, my boat was destroyed and I somehow lost my clothes. If that wasn’t bad enough, the impact of the landing broke my leg.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

On the bright side, it did save me the trouble of removing those clothes. When I got home I found something on my kitchen table. It turned out to be a wedding invitation written in gold lettering. My first instinct upon seeing it was to not read it and throw it away. I ended up deciding against that.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I figured that it couldn’t hurt to look at the message it held. To summarize what it said, it invited me to a [wedding](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/f81csp/the_wedding_singer/) in a town which I will not state the name of here. This may come as a shock but I didn’t attend it and I have moved to a new place since this all happened.  If you’re wondering how he got the invitation into my home, I’m just as clueless as you are and I’m not sure I want to know. To conclude this post I will share what it said with certain information omitted.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

*Hello, Cody, I hope you are doing well. I must admit I was very disappointed you had to leave the party early. That doesn’t really matter, though because I have another event for you to attend. I’m sure you gathered from looking at this card’s cover that the event in question is a wedding. It will be held in a town called (redacted).* 

&amp;#x200B;

*I hope you can attend. It would be nice to see a familiar face. After all, I would love to take you back to my party.  If you do choose to go I will be under another name. You will find it under this message.*

&amp;#x200B;

*Sincerely,*

&amp;#x200B;

2020-11-15 07:04:42 : Finish up build for my RTX 3070 FE and some parts from my old PC : Hadeeen : https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/juhw7y/finish_up_build_for_my_rtx_3070_fe_and_some_parts/

&gt;&gt;**What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.**
 
Main use will be gaming. Want to upgrade to at least 1440p 144Hz gaming and run Cyberpunk on high/ultra settings.
 
&gt;**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?**
 
$1500 AUD for the parts I still need.
 
&gt;**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.**
 
During December ideally. In 2 weeks is the plan.
 
&gt;**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc\)**
 
Need tower and monitor. I have parts already ready and from my old PC which I can re-use if you think they still hold up.
 
&gt;**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?**
 
Australia (NSW)
 
&gt;**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.**
 
Parts I have ready to use: 
&gt; * GPU: RTX 3070 FE
&gt; * Motherboard: ASUS Prime Z390-A ATX LGA1151 from a friend
&gt; * Keyboard and mouse

Parts I have from my old PC which I can re-use if you think they're still good enough:
&gt; * CPU Cooler: Noctua NH-D14 
&gt; * Storage: SanDisk Ultra Plus 128GB (Model no. SDSSDHP-128G) which has Windows OS on it and ADATA Ultimate SU630 480GB (Model no. ASU630SS-480GQ) which has some games installed already
&gt; * Case: Corsair 200R ATX Mid Tower Case
&gt; * PSU: Corsair CX500M (unused just been sitting in the box for a few years)
&gt; * Monitor: BenQ Zowie RL2455S
&gt; * A couple case fans 
 
&gt;**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?**
 
Not in near future. 
 
&gt;**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**
 
Apart from the parts I already have ready, at least 1TB storage would be nice. My friend said to get at least 8 core CPU, what do you think? I would like to upgrade to high refresh rate and higher resolution gaming but understand if it doesn't fit in the budget.
 
&gt;**What type of network connectivity do you need? (Wired and/or WiFi) If WiFi is needed and you would like to find the fastest match for your wireless router, please list any specifics.**
 
Have a LAN cable and also a WiFi USB dongle so should be fine. Also have a Bluetooth USB dongle already. 
 
&gt;**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**
 
If you think a case upgrade is worth it, same size or smaller and a clean black/white aesthetic preferably. 
 
&gt;**Do you need a copy of Windows included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference?**
 
No
 
&gt;**Extra info or particulars:**

Thanks for reading through all this and helping. I am not sure whether or not to re-use the parts I have from my old PC, but as long as the end result fits under the budget it's ok.

2020-11-15 07:04:39 : 25M, having weird unsteady/dizzy spells accompanied by foot or finger pain. : FoxPristine : https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/juhw76/25m_having_weird_unsteadydizzy_spells_accompanied/

Hey. I'm a 25yo male, 240lbs 5'7" in Canada.

A couple weeks ago i was at work and took an unexplained dizzy spell that really freaked me out. Basically I simply turned around standing up and it felt like the floor was moving, that i was going to oak over or pass out. I went to the ER as that never happened to me before and it came on totally suddenly. Sugars were good, blood pressure and ecg were good and nothing was found, I felt better by the time i left. Since then, it's been happening nearly daily to a much lesser severity. I've noticed though, that when this happens I'll get a pain in my right foot that isn't quite sharp, but it's very localized, almost cramp-like while not really being a cramp. More recently I've also noticed a right wrist pain to go along with it as well, a pain that kinda radiates up into my fingers. Usually when these spells come on a few hours into the day, I feel funky for the rest of the day - a little foggy, lingering pains in foot and wrist, small spells of being off balance. It's really starting to bug me, but I don't really know if any of this is even related. The last time I went to my GP about odd symptom combinations he basically told me it was all in my head and to stop worrying so I really don't want to make an appointment quite yet. 

I do not smoke, I do drink usually each weekend, I don't have any previously diagnosed conditions or take any prescription medication. I've tried to look up these symptoms but I can't really find any discussion about them being together at once and also related to one another. Perhaps is literally just anxiety and it'll pass eventually, or maybe it's something more. Either way I'd like to start trying to find out what's up, so I'd like to understand what might be happening a bit more before I go to my doctor about it so i can actually have a more useful discussion with him about this.

2020-11-15 07:04:37 : Cats bum is swollen : babynicko : https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/juhw6d/cats_bum_is_swollen/

Hello,

My cat has had a swollen bum since he was a kitten. When I asked the vet originally he said not to worry as it would cause my cat more pain to do a biopsy. 
Today it seems very swollen with a little bit of blood I think due to his obsessive licking. 
Other than licking lots he does not appear to be in any pain or discomfort and does not get upset if I touch it. 
He is 5 years old with no constipation or diarrhea issues. 
Just wondering if I should take him to the vet

2020-11-15 07:05:34 : Always in pain - gets worse at night in bed, breathing makes sharp pain. : Vivirin : https://www.reddit.com/r/KidneyStones/comments/juhwll/always_in_pain_gets_worse_at_night_in_bed/

So, I've been dealing with stones a year now as of two days ago. I had multiple spells of insane flank pain that hospitalised me and I was given antibiotics to treat it but it never went away. Fast forward six months and u finally have CT scans and an ultrasound and turns out I had two stones in my left kidney - one 5mm and one 7mm. They told me that I'd be fine and that was that.

Fast forward again to September where I had incredible pain and I went to hospital, they did scans again and turns out I had one stone at 10mm size. They placed a stent in me and things were alright for a week despite the constant blood and frequency.

Now ever since about the two month mark, I've had nothing but burning and stinging whenever I urinate and just general pain throughout the day. The stinging and burning has gone over time whilst urinating but the pain when not urinating has increased. Now I can no longer laugh, take deep breaths, cough or sneeze without having pain that feels like razor blades shooting down my urethra. I've been prescribed codeine at the highest available dose here but it seems to do very little. The first time I took it was the most effective and I essentially got high but ever since I've felt little to no difference after taking it.

So, one night was so unbearable that I hadn't slept in 30 hours and I could barely move so I had an ambulance called out to me and I went back to hospital yet again (I'm in the UK, so don't worry, this isn't costing me my life savings luckily). On the way to hospital I had gas and air which made me burst out into laughter which then hurt like a bitch, which then made me inhale more which made me laugh more and so on. I got to the hospital and they gave me morphine which allowed me to get some rest but I was still in pain. I had more scans and stayed overnight and apparently I have one stone now - not two. It's 4mm and in my ureter. My stentis apparently completely fine and not the cause of all the sharp genital pain that has occured since I got the thing placed.

Now, let me clarify some things - when I talk about the current pain, it is sharp, it stings, sometimes it's just a constant itch and it is entirely localised in my genitals. I get blood in my urine - but normally only when I push hard when urinating / towards the end of urinating. When I do urinate, it feels like something is in my urethra and it almost tricks me into thinking I can push it out. If I fall for it and start pushing hard, I will be in much more pain than before, but goddamnit I want this fucker out of me so I fall for it every time.

And now for my last question: will this fuckin thing pass eventually it will I have to wait until it's removed manually? Any tips in how to speed things up, too? All u want to do is laugh again or leave the house for a short walk that doesn't leave me in agony. 

I have moved about 300+ miles from home since my stent surgery and due to covid the new hospital I'm at isn't doing any non-emergency surgeries for at least 3 weeks, and then I have the referral and waiting times on top of that will see me having to wait at least 10 weeks to remove my stent and stone. I really, really don't want to wait that long. This is the worst pain I've ever been in - and I have chron's disease which caused me to lose 10kg in a single month due to stomach pain every time I ate or drank anything. I usually have a very high pain tolerance. I used to skateboard and I can walk injuries off just fine. Hell, I've manually relocated a dislocated shoulder, but this... This is just hell. Words can't describe this kind of pain.

I just need some help or advice. Anything. I'm really desperate now

2020-11-15 07:05:28 : [A Spark For a Heart] - Ch 1 - Fantasy/Romance : amihanthewitch : https://www.reddit.com/r/redditserials/comments/juhwjw/a_spark_for_a_heart_ch_1_fantasyromance/

  
"*Ooh, it's just so exciting!*" the witch squealed with delight, clapping her gloved hands together in anticipation. The brim of her sun hat bobbed up and down with her; the shade did nothing to conceal her glowing excitement.

Her apprentice, a small boy in a pink striped apron and a head of dark hair fluffy as a husky butt in winter, puffed air out his lips, clearly bored. He squinted up at her with his hand shielding his eyes from the sun. "Didn't you say this happens every year?"

The witch smiled despite his annoyed tone. He was ten but his voice still held that baby quality where his words didn't form quite right in his mouth and came out with missing letters. She patted his head twice. "Yes, Marco," she answered sweetly, "And I can *still* be excited, *that's* how special this time of year is for us."

The "us" in question meant, "Us, witches." Marco knew that much, though oftentimes he didn't feel like he knew much of anything. Despite her cheerful demeanor, his mentor could be cryptic.

He didn't fully understand yet what a rare honor it was to be the apprentice of Hestia Laveau, the Greatest Witch of the Generation.

It could have been her age; she was younger than most coven witches of her caliber. Or maybe it was that she twirled around in tulle skirts and cried when her fingers caught in her long, curly hair when she braided it.

"See, the gnomes we've been tending to?" Hestia went on, pointing to the small garden where the gnomes he'd watched her craft stood sentry. He nodded. "We crafted each one by hand from the clay of the Ancients, fired them by ritual rite, and imbued them with just the right amounts of care and magic to help them grow. It's taken months and *today,* Marco, is when we see the fruits of that labor."

Her eyes were soft as she looked at the clay gnomes, all smiling up at her, holding a different gardening tool, frozen in varying degrees of work and pleasure. He was always included when she talked about her crafting, but Marco didn't think he did much to deserve such credit.

Their preparations for this ritual had started in winter on the first day of snowfall. Hestia had Marco collect the clearest snow, which she then melted in her largest copper pot to boil with a scattering of herbs and spices. She cooled the water and together, they’d kneaded the ancient clay to a workable consistency and from then Hestia did her work in private. Marco had tried to watch, mostly from afar while he did her busy work, crushing eggshells for protection, collecting and drying the herbs she needed then storing what she didn’t. She always needed rosemary.

When Hestia worked, it was best not to disturb her lest she break concentration. Often, Marco slipped in and out of the room seemingly unnoticed, leaving the requested items on the table or sometimes outside the door.

Once in the damp part of springtime, he’d brought in her tea to see her sitting at her pottery wheel, glaring at the same gnome she’d been working on for the better part of a week. He asked her if he could help with anything.

“Next year,” she’d said with a knowing look as she sipped from the cup, her hands covered in clay. He left on silent feet to leave her to work.

Now, looking at the cheery little things, Marco remembered Hestia's face as she'd decorated each gnome from the paints they'd made from the herbs, roots, and pigments in the garden. She’d hum to herself or speak soft spells to them while he mulled each new color of the brilliant paints for the next gnome. Every now and again she would look wistfully out into the air before continuing her work as if inspiration had struck her. Or divine intervention.

"Our gnomes will hatch into the brilliant wizards they were meant to be," she finished, looking proud, "And no matter what magic we gave them as gnomes, there is no way to know them as wizards until we meet them. Now, isn't that exciting, Marco?"

Marco looked at the gnomes but felt no such pride. The one Hestia had agonized over stood in a prime spot, the obvious favorite of the group. (Though he knew she’d deny it if she said it). He thought of how she kissed the heads of each one before placing them carefully on the flower beds. No, he felt nothing close to that kind of love for the things. Still, either to entertain or to spare his mentor's feelings, his mouth smiled and he nodded.

It was enough. The witch put her arm around her apprentice and her familiar scent of lemongrass and clean linen embraced him with her. He let her and let his small smile turn real.

Hestia knew he was a good kid. That, of course, had been learned over the last year together. What really drew her to him was his power, the potential she’d seen in him the second they matched eyes. That made her sound cruel, power-hungry even. But it wasn’t the use of his power or the want of it she felt. It was the glow of his power that sent the ringing of a gong resonating in her heart. His was a familiar glow, one she’d only ever seen in her own mirror.

He was like her.

An orphan with more power than he knew what to do with, cast aside in the coven and undesirable to any sensible witch with a lick of experience. A witch alone had enough volatility to ruin a spell; no need for another one in the room to turn a simple draught nuclear. Only the surest, dependable, and ageless witches dared take on apprentices outside their own blood. Mothers often raised their children in magic to ease into apprenticeship while those unlucky to be born to mortals were abandoned and embraced into the fold. Yet apprenticeship for those lot was still scarce. Some thought it better to let the most volatile young witches smother themselves in their inexperience so that by the time they came of age and sent out to stake their names in the world, their powers barely satisfied their house chores. Rarely did a lone witch rise to a power greater than that.

Until Hestia.

Still a young witch by all measures but power, Hestia had looked at Marco and though she’d never planned to apprentice a new witch before that moment, Marco became her exception.

“It should be happening any second now, right?” Marco asked her.

“Yes,” she answered in a wistful voice that caught her off guard.

The witch looked down at her apprentice and patted his hair, which sprung back up despite her touch. He was a good apprentice, she thought to herself every day, better than she deserved. He was patient despite her moods and even humored her when she burst into the cottage, both her baskets and mouth spilling her plans for new spells. Marco always looked up from the mortar and pestle, his book, whatever he was working on, and put it down immediately. He’d rush to her, taking whatever was falling from her arms, and then scold her for being careless when the chamomile came out bent or the apples bruised. She’d laugh. She knew sometimes she was too silly, too excitable, too sentimental. But the boy seemed to draw it out of her. To see him enjoy himself, even at her expense, felt like a great gift.

Now she stood with him, her young apprentice, proud and warm from the feeling of familial care she'd grown to feel for him. The sun beat down on them as it crawled to its peak.

She pointed up at it. ”At the brightest point of the day, the sun will warm the earth and--"

"The gnomes will crack and wizards will hatch," He finished.

"You listened," she said happily, shaking his arm playfully.

"Of course I did," he said without looking at her.

So the witch and her apprentice waited together in the sun to welcome their new arrivals, feeling the farthest from lonely they'd been in a very long while.

2020-11-15 07:06:00 : [IWantout] 27M Student -&gt; UK : Feeling_Excitement_2 : https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/juhwro/iwantout_27m_student_uk/

I'm looking to relocate to the UK permanently, and I have been told that getting a Student Visa is the best option for me, seeing as how I don't have ancestry rights and/or family living there. With that being said, I was thinking about enrolling in school there under a Tier 4 Visa to get my degree there and then look for work. However, I don't know the practicalities of that. 

Does anyone know how likely it is to get employment after graduation as an international student? Can you be an international student looking to get a Bachelors or does it HAVE to be a master's? Furthermore, does anyone know what schools are great options for international students like myself looking to come from the U.S.? Are there any degrees that are better than others? I have had conversations with many people, and the consensus seems to be that I might need to pick between my career choice and my living destination, so this is me making that choice.

If you know anything regarding ways to work the international school system there for admissions and finance things, I would greatly appreciate it. Also, ANYTHING Visa related is always welcome.

2020-11-15 07:05:51 : Parents Handled All Loans : inkyMayhem : https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentLoans/comments/juhwpn/parents_handled_all_loans/

Hi, so when I was 17 I got accepted to college. My parents did not let me be involved in the student loan process from day 1, and now I owe $140,000 to Sallie Mae. Due to COVID I am currently unemployed but cannot receive benefits. They want me to pay $1,400 a month. 

My question is, am I actually responsible for these loans? They have my name on them and my step-father cosigned them but I never signed them myself. 

That being said, I won't be able to get a job in my career field (Game Development) because my school was extremely predatory &amp; misrepresented the employment rate. 

I just want to get out of these loans but don't want to kill myself because then nobody will take care of my cat. Please help.

2020-11-15 07:05:47 : Bad experience tonight : CiggyBitch : https://www.reddit.com/r/doordash_drivers/comments/juhwom/bad_experience_tonight/

So let me preface by saying i usually try to follow delivery instructions to a T. I don’t do any more or less than what’s listed in the instructions part of the app. So on leave at the door deliveries if you don’t tell me to knock or ring the doorbell I don’t. 1) I feel it’s unnecessary in the leave at the door option because I also utilize DoorDash and you get the text notification immediately with the picture that your order has been delivered. 2) some people don’t like to have the door knocked/ bell rang especially in the evening and I interpret it as if it’s not requested- don’t do it. 

I’m also going to use they pronouns for the customer for anonymity.

Well tonight I had a delivery from a cheap pizza place. It was a $3 delivery no tip and it was a bit of a drive across town. I don’t mind doing lower paying deliveries everybody’s gotta eat and I tend to have empathy - they were already getting decently cheap food maybe they couldn’t afford to tip. 🤷🏻‍♀️ 

It was raining tonight where I’m at, but for the majority duration of the showers it was just sprinkling. There was like 20-30 minutes max where it was a legit storm. 

Upon arriving at the address I was a little confused. No lights were on in the trailer not even a porch light and I could see through the windows of the trailer and from the light of the other trailers around it in the park that there was no furniture inside, no curtains etc. I started getting sketchy vibes. 

The request was to leave the items at the door and there was no awning on the porch. In the rain. Personally, I feel it’s not my responsibility to decide for you how the items should be delivered. You have two options in the app and you chose one and even have a section to write in additional instructions. If you don’t choose the delivery option that’s best for you that is a result of your own negligence. 

So I follow the instructions in the app, leave the pizza on the porch take a photo submit and I peel out. Like I mentioned earlier I got sketch vibes it really didn’t even look like anyone was home- much less lived there. 

I get a call an hour later from the customer who said that they received the picture of the food but that it wasn’t on the porch. I apologized, and referred them to call DoorDash to request a refund. They start yelling saying they already tried that and no one will help them.  They go on to explain their kids were home alone- and specifically mentions the children are 7 and 2 and now they will not be able to eat tonight. I apologize again, and ensure that I left the food on the porch according to instructions. They continue yelling and say I should’ve knocked because the kids were there alone and they were out “stuck in the storm”. And when they realize I’m not going to turn around and give them money they hang up. 

There’s a lot that could have happened. Someone could’ve stolen the food. They could be lying just to try and get a refund. Etc. I also personally feel no one should be leaving a 7 and 2 year old home alone for any reason and felt maybe they were just trying to pull on my heart strings to give them their money back. 

There was also a part of me that felt it could’ve been an attempt to rob me. (Maybe I’m just being paranoid) but if they didn’t realize they chose to leave it at the door maybe they were originally trying to get me to deliver to a vacant property in the rain at night, pull me inside and jack me. (Would’ve been worthless bc I rarely get cash tips I maybe had $10 in cash tips tonight) I feel this way for a couple reasons- 1) I could tell on the phone they were hoping I’d cave and turn around, even providing their address again over the phone. 2) I dash on the side. My regular job I work in the fraud/ security department for a bank. I’m trained in recognizing social engineering in cases of fraud. Typically when people are trying to push an emotional response out of you, are belligerent and provide you with a strong sense of urgency to their requests/concerns it’s because they’re trying to manipulate the situation and tend to be scamming. 3) I just had this pit in my stomach that this situation wasn’t right. 

Any advice? Similar experiences? Am I wrong?

2020-11-15 07:06:09 : PS4 BUG: There are no opals in my game... : samOmighty : https://www.reddit.com/r/ACValhalla/comments/juhwtw/ps4_bug_there_are_no_opals_in_my_game/

I have an unusual bug where I can see the opal map icon but when I go to investigate and loot it, there is no opal. At first I thought that maybe I had to unlock that area of the map, synchronized that area, went back to the last opal location and it was still... missing. 

To make sure that the opal isn't underground or anything like that, I went to YT and searched for opal locations for the Rygjafylke area and in the few videos available, the player was at all the same opal locations and was able to see them and loot them. In my game, they simply are not there. 

How important are the opals in the game? I ask because I really dont want to go back to all these opals if/when this bug gets fixed so, is it an item I can just skip? Or, are there enough in the game that I can hopefully eventually loot 1 out of 10 or so, or should I just stop playing until this bug gets worked out?

2020-11-15 07:06:36 : Problems trying to officially leave the church : cas_ass : https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/juhwzv/problems_trying_to_officially_leave_the_church/

I haven't been in the church since I was 18, about 5 years ago, however I never had my records removed. 

I know that in that time my parents have changed my address in the church records as we moved right before I went to college and left the church. I have moved 6 times in this span of years and my parents have moved twice. Thus I can't get my records removed by sending a letter or going through quitmormon cause I don't know what address my records would be under and I don't know what ward it would be either. 

I don't have a login to the lds website so I can't change anything in my records without going in physically. 

Is it possible that I can go in to the church building and get my records removed by just having the bishop update my information and then remove me? Or do I have to go through the excommunication process? 

I'm fine with going through the excommunication process, I have plenty of things that can get me excommunicated. I'm more wondering if anyone else has been in this situation and want any advice that anyone could give me on it. 

Thank you

2020-11-15 07:07:07 : $PYLON: Own Part Of The Largest US ETH Mining Operation (25% - 250% APY) : bestwhoeverhad : https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/juhx7a/pylon_own_part_of_the_largest_us_eth_mining/

If you've been trying to chase next "gem" but find you're self getting dumped, or even worse, rug-pulled, over and over, then read every single word of this post very carefully.

PYLON is a DeFi project that essentially pays holders revenue generated by their ETH mining farm, which happens to be the biggest in North America (#1 on here: https://ethereum.miningpoolhub.com/index.php?page=statistics&amp;action=pool).

Now this is important because it ensures each PYLON token is backed by real tangible income from mining profits. This is a completely different business model from 99% of tokens which are essentially just generated out of thin-air and have no real world value or use case.

The team accomplished this by creating a series of yield-farming projects that took performance fees to expand their mining operation They raised around $1M USD, and used that for new mining rigs, which are now completed and ready to send the mining revenue back to PYLON holders.

How? The mines process transactions on the ETH network and accumulate gas fees in the form of ETH. The ETH is used to market buy PYLON and distribute them to stakers. This insures the PYLON tokens stakers receive as dividends are backed by actual liquidity. Of course, stakers can choose to sell the PYLON for ETH or continue holding.

Right now ETH is the most profitable cryptocurrency to mine. Historically, ETH yields 25% APY during bear markets and 250% APY during bull markets (like the one we're heading into right now). The team has been in the mining business for 7-8 years so they have experience under their belts.

Now let's be honest. 250% APY isn't that sexy considering some farms have yields in the 4-5 figure range. However, the important you must keep in mind is this is a REAL-WORLD BUSINESS that runs 24/7 and will still be here 2 years from now. You can't say that about 99.9% of yield farming projects. 

Smart money is just starting to flow into crypto (hence the BTC and ETH pump), and it's only a matter of time before it discovers the PYLON project, which has fantastic returns compared to traditional investments but more importantly, has lower risk because it's backed by tangible assets. 

IMO, Pylon is one of the most innovative DeFi projects because it's literally decentralizing investing in real world businesses. You no longer need to be located in a specific country, or jump through legal hoops to own your share of this lucrative business.

If you're reading this now (around mid-November 2020), then you're lucky because Pylon JUST came out of it's accumulation phase. The team has been working on building their new mines in the last 2 months (check their Twitter for proof), and the vaults are finally ready so stakers will get rewards soon. 

This project got fudded hard ever since the launch, because the team was a bit all over the place and launched multiple projects in between. But now, weak hands are out, the whales have their positions ready and the uptrend is starting. 

Unfortunately, you missed accumulating Pylon cheap at $100-150 but the price is only about 2x up from the lows. It's still only at $1.7M marketcap which is still tiny for a project of this scope. (Again, it's not fake internet money here. It's hundreds of real GPU mining rigs.) I believe no reason why PYLON won't go to $2,000 or higher in the upcoming bull season. 

So if you've ever wanted to own part of an ETH mining farm without having to build one yourself, then here's your chance. But act fast because once the first mining rewards are live (in about a week), we probably won't see sub $300 PYLON ever again.

P.S. You might be wondering what will happen when ETH switches to 2.0. PYLON will be fine because ETH won't transition to 100% proof-of-stake for another 2 years at least. And even then, the PYLON GPU mines can just switch to another POW coin like Monero (it may not be profitable as Ethereum, but will be profitable nonetheless).

2020-11-15 07:07:05 : Petsmart chaos : zoeemarii : https://www.reddit.com/r/Aquariums/comments/juhx6q/petsmart_chaos/

Dear god. I truly do not know how to express my emotions atm. 

Today I walked into Petsmart to get a pH test strip kit for my tank. I decided to go walk around the store and oh boy was I surprised.

While looking at the fish, I discovered about 400 neon tetras crammed into a 20 gallon tank. The ghost shrimp had horsehair parasites OOZING OUT OF THEM. They literally were slowly dying and it was awful for me as a licensed vet assistant as well as tech in training to see them suffering. 

To make matters worse, I overheard a family discussing the purchase of a betta fish for their 3 young children. Not only did the staff member advise them to get 3 INDIVIDUAL MALE BETTAS FOR A 10 GALLON TANK... she told the family that they did NOT need any sort of heater, could use plastic plants, and should feed the bettas SINKING GOLDFISH FOOD. For gods sake their mouths are upturned and cannot eat like that smh. I just wanted to scream at her. 

Petsmart needs to educate their employees on aquatics care. I’m calling corporate to complain as this isn’t my first time having an issue with that store. They have thrown live reptiles/rodents away and made me fish them out of the trash can half alive to take time to care for them and rehome them, all because Petsmart is too inconsiderate to treat these animals with respect.

Anyways, stop buying live animals from Petsmart plz and ty❤️

Im new to the flashlight community and need help picking a flashlight for a particular situation. There are these two feral cats I find digging through my trash bins. I need a light that will focus on them and share them off. I don't want anything too crazy that may damage their eyes as I don't want them to get mad at me (I get embarrassed easily). I tried putting a lock on the bins but the city issued a warning for tampering with their property. I've considered moving but I think scaring them off with a light is the best course of action. Please help with recommendations. Thanks.

În prima săptămână oficială de campanie, bătălia electorală s-a dus în Parlament și de la Cotroceni. PSD, PNL. USR și Pro România au încercat să-și ia fața unul altuia fie prin oferta de premieri „vânduți” unul mai bun decât celălalt, fie prin promisiuni gata de pus în practică după 6 decembrie încolo. Momente culminante în discursul public al partidelor au fost închiderea piețelor, „Fără penali în funcții publice” și interzicerea locală a sloganului USR-PLUS „O Românie fără hoție”.

In faith we have lyrics with multiple interpretations as "all the cats are grey" lyrics or in other voices.

Specially thinking about one sentence in the last song that says: "rape me like a child, christined in blood". Does anybody knows why is robert talking about? i just don't get it

I just got into the F13 franchise as of the last month or two, and I was thinking about getting the game - only to learn about all these legal troubles, and that the game's dedicated servers have gone down and it won't get any new updates. Other posts on this subreddit indicate there there's still some heavy player base, but I'm still kind of up in the air about whether to buy it with all those concerns. It does seem like I might've missed the game's heyday, but what do y'all think?

Is it still worth getting F13 the game?

Thanks!

I'm currently playing Renegade Platinum and trying to catch Mew so I can finish the national dex but for some reason, I can't find any berries. For some reason, the berries do not seem to have spawned into the game. If anyone can help that would be great. I'm using Twilight Menu to play the game on a 3DS so I can use any hacks to glitch some berries into the game.

2020-11-15 07:08:55 : Superannuation funds – is there a way to find the actual ASX companies the fund’s pre-mix option are invested in, or about to invest in? : emmawarner00 : https://www.reddit.com/r/AusFinance/comments/juhxva/superannuation_funds_is_there_a_way_to_find_the/

Hi all,
Hoping to find some suggestions here.
A certain super fund is funding a company that has initiated predatory action against another company that I’m heavily invested in. 
The raiding company has only had accelerating losses (last year was about 100m aud).
So for the moment, without having to go thru the specifics of both companies (also to avoid naming all companies concerned, for now), the reason why I opened this thread is to find out if there’s a way to get a list of where a super fund has invested into which Australian companies? The only option I know of is to go thru each and every ASX-listed company’s announcements. 
At the moment I know of two: the raiding company, and another one where the shareprice was pumped and dumped a few months later after the super fund’s investment.
I tried to make this clear, but if anyone needs more clarification, please let me know. 
Thanks in advance!

Looking for advice on getting a new vehicle. We have two for sale in my area that sort of fit my criteria- a ‘14 sr5 w/ 50k miles or a ‘15 pro w/ 100k miles. The 15 is about 3k more expensive, but does come with pre-existing modifications like a brush guard, which I would be adding to the sr5 if I got it. Not really doing any serious off roading (maybe once in a blue moon), but do drive in snowy/back road conditions. I’ve had a wrangler for four years, but the electrical upkeep needed for it is ridiculous. Either way is the higher mileage a concern? i’ve heard Tacoma’s last a long time? Is there anything specific I should be looking for prior to buying that i’m just not thinking of (mods/issues/etc)?Should i keep looking for an actual OR tacoma? I’ve heard the sr5 was pretty capable, but i’ve never tried one myself. Any advice or tips would be greatly appreciated!

2020-11-15 07:09:28 : A few minor but highly irritating issues. Anyone else/ fix ideas ? : MoonlitStar : https://www.reddit.com/r/SimsMobile/comments/juhy2n/a_few_minor_but_highly_irritating_issues_anyone/

My game has recently, I'd say maybe in the last month or so but not much longer, developed these annoying AF issues and I can't seem to fix them.

The sound (music, sound effects) completely disappears at random times for different amounts of time then comes back. No pattern to it, just happens.

I can no longer see Izzy effects on outfits in my home at all, not on my Sims or attendees Sims whilst hosting a party. I can however see the effects everywhere else in game , incl friends houses and parties  I attend (friends and randoms).

The most annoying of all, I get notifications (always llama zoom ones -arghh) every time I come out the game or watch an ad. This never happened before and have been playing over 2 years. The only thing that stops it is if I'm actively taking part in a Lama Zoom. If my sims are all doing events but not in a LZ, I still get them. I get LZ notifications every time when my sims have completed a non-LZ task. I get them if no one is doing anything in game.

Any ideas have to remedy ? Thank you

This is not a post motivated by politics. I do not care what candidate you prefer, however,  I am curious what the ramifications of a self pardon or clemency are. Does a pardon imply admission of guilt and, if so, does that in any way shape or form play a roll for future candidacies on the federal level? Security clearances?

Because people haven't been taking precautions seriously enough en masse? We're seeing a large uptick in cases and hospitalizations right now, which was predicted as the winter months approached. It was also predicted that we would be able to mitigate those effects of everyone listened to the guidelines, but the message has been muddled by politicization of basic health advice from the experts.

I feel like the response I get from those critical of masks often suggests that you think if masks don't completely protect one from getting Covid, then there's no point. But it does reduce spread, as studies have indicated. We also use seat belts, even though car crashes can still kill you, as well as many other societal safeguards designed to reduce risk of injury or death.

I don't believe I'm on the wrong side of history. My conservatism is a deep conviction.

Do I question right-wing figures and their intentions/competency? All the time. Have I considered Trump might be a not-so-great guy? Yes, many times.

One thing I do know, corruption in this country is unhinged. The Bushes, Clintons, and Bidens are clearly complicit. If Trump is corrupt, his corruption has been 4 years. Bush, Clinton, and Biden's corruptions are dynastic.

Trump as a freedom fighter is mythology, but it confirms its own bias through the vilification of him by dynastic corruption. The enemy of my enemy is my friend. I pray that my intuition that he's not so bad is correct.

2020-11-15 07:11:17 : So I Quit My Big Dream of Becoming A Musician - What Now - Tough Times : annonymusperson2003 : https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/juhyqf/so_i_quit_my_big_dream_of_becoming_a_musician/

Hello! So I am currently a 12th grader, ever since I was in 8th grade, I have had this dream about becoming a musician just like my violin teacher because I was so awed at how great she played, so me being brave, I took on the challenge and trained for 3-4 years. I have played the violin for 12 years now but I'm not the best player, my notes aren't perfect. Recently, it’s been very difficult for me.

Not because of the pandemic, 

But because after years and years of training to be a so - called “professional musician,” 

I finally quit the dream.

Knowing me, I look really strong on the outside because that’s what I’m trying to keep. But right now, I just feel like those pile of bricks that crashed once you put something on top of it.

Now, I don’t really apologize about what I did because I knew it would be for the better for my life existence and mental health. The reasons behind this decisions were music was too difficult to study. I know that non - musicians wouldn’t see the pain I had to go through either physically or emotionally but I couldn’t bare it any longer.

As a person, I am authentic. I love to think about new ideas, study old ideas and why they are put together that way. I enjoy subjects like Philosophy, 21st Century Literature, and Creative Industries. Making projects excite me - working on something hands on is much more fit for me rather than vomiting answers in the traditional sense. I'm studying in an art school, thinking about pursuing art, but not specifically only drawing - but the ideas of art and how they come together. 

When I was in training, I really couldn’t bare the pain at all. I don’t like the fact that you are told once that “You’re good! You’re so good!” ( hey I even got flying colors during my last graduation recital! ) but then the next thing you know, they put you down. Like very down. I know that I had to be emotionally strong and yes I built up my emotional strength and managed not to cry whenever I got shouted at, but deep down inside my mental health was losing it - I couldn’t bare to see others who were faster at getting things than I was - I know we don’t start as “the best” but I cannot meet these standards no matter how hard I tried. Heck, I even attended 2-3 music theory classes just to get things inside my head before the college of music talent test, but my brain capacity really couldn’t handle all the information, and even going to orchestra online made me super anxious that I had to take a big break, even though that meant not seeing my friends again on Saturdays which was really saddening. They were the people who I got along with the most, because in my current school, I don’t have friends. Most of my friends come from other schools I have been to, but none in this one. But within studying music, I was sick of being gaslighted all the time, being looked at strangely for being really slow at getting things right, it really just was not for me and I don’t apologize for leaving the dream behind. 

Sometimes when my mom listens to the records of myself playing, I think it’s someone else because it’s SO GOOD ( not to brag hahahaha ) like the quality of playing is like WOW and they HAD TO PUT ME DOWN every single time- I knew I was good enough but apparently not good enough for most of my teacher’s standards, no matter how hard I tried. 

If my physical and mental health is something I’d need to risk just to getting in a music school and if people treat me that way all the time, making me feel very anxious making my self esteem disappear, I wouldn’t want to be in that place anymore. So on October 31, 2020 after a very stressful halloween recital, I decided to change all my applications that were music based to something I could see myself actually doing - like right now, the most promising I can see myself doing is studying art and managing some organization - or even a museum. But I really don’t know, and at this point, I don’t know why I’m too scared to reach out to my friends—- for some reason. I don't want to bother them and make my problems their problems, too. 

The thing is though, I’ve been super anxious about this also. Having a dream for music by my side since 2016 was like having a security blanket. Like, yeah! This is where I’m going. But now, it’s completely gone, and now I’ve been reaching out to my other art teachers about this who are giving me super great recommendations such as Art Studies, but I hope I’ll get into a college near where I live, the current school I’m looking at is Ateneo and U.P., ( good well known schools in the Philippines ) but mostly Ateneo because it’s a familiar school  plus I have a difficult time walking around places so it would help to be somewhere familiar, but it’s just really sad and painful that I’m leaving something that gave me so many friends and memories. I don’t even know if my friends will even support me anymore. But I know that I’m doing the right thing, and I know I am doing myself a big favor. But I know that there is hope because one of my violin friends just recruited me to join an org  and this brightened up my path a bit but I’m really just scared. Plus my mom has been having problems with work to so I can’t really open up to her that much and keep repeating the same issue I have with her- so there that’s my story. I'm just really anxious HJSBJHDBH I'm currently exploring new hobbies but I'm in need of friends because school just really sucks rn if you guys have any suggestions what I can do with my life right now that would be great AAAH I'm also afraid of telling my piano teacher about this dilemma even though she told me it's okay to share my thoughts - it's just that I'm scared of disappointing her that I dropped the dream all of a sudden :&lt; what to do??? :&lt;&lt;&lt;

As early as A.D. 110, Ignatius of Antioch is already talking about there being a "Catholic Church" which seems to be centered around a growing monarchial episcopacy developing throughout the Christian world (with he himself promoting it), how exactly did this movement arise within early Christianity and why? Was it made up of Pauline, Johannine, and Petrine Christians who all decided to band together? Or were there other kinds of groups involved? Was it in response to any particular situation?

C,


I hate that we found each other when we did. I wanted to take on the world with you but you needed to heal

I know you said you weren't expecting a response from me but maybe you did. I was drunk and angry that you told me through text. I didn't get back to you right away because I needed to step back so I didn't say anything that I didn't mean. The time we spent together meant a lot to me, please dont think otherwise. But I felt alone in this. I didn't feel like a priority to you and it seemed that way for a while.

Im not perfect and eventually I was burnt out. Whenever I tried to talk about what was on your mind you kept me out and whenever I backed away to give you space it seemed like you resented me for it. I can't in good conscience leave you alone when I know you're upset. But what would you expect me to do if you kept me at arms length?

I'm not making excuses for you because I understand where you're coming from and I forgive you. I've been there. I love you and hope you're doing well.

You never communicated well enough with me that I could be certain of you, or certain of us. To be completely honest, it was unreasonable for me to think we could even go the distance given the circumstances. Life's cruel like that I guess.

I know i said that relationships can be a very selfish thing but my wants are for you. I want the best for you. To be happy and fulfilled among other things.

I dont know if this is the end for us and its hard to think so but if we're lucky enough to meet again, I hope we're ready for each other.


Sincerely,

2020-11-15 07:11:34 : February 24th 1978. Yuma, California. 5 men go missing after a basketball game. : CommunicationBrave35 : https://www.reddit.com/r/coldcases/comments/juhyu6/february_24th_1978_yuma_california_5_men_go/

On February 24, 1978, a group of friends from Yuba City in California; Gary Dale Mathias, Jack Madruga, Jackie Huett, Theodore (Ted) Weiher and William Sterling; set out on a trip to watch a basketball game. They left after it finished and then somehow drove up a mountain into the wilderness and were never seen alive again.

The group aged between 24 and 32 years of age, had developmental disabilities and were all enrolled in a day program for mentally handicapped adults. But that did not mean that they were unable to function in society, quite the opposite.

Of the group, Gary Mathias had the most severe mental health He was suffering from schizophrenia and was on medication to control his symptoms. Jack had low I.Q.  but hadn’t been diagnosed as mentally disabled and both him and Gary had served in the U.S. Army and had driver’s licenses.

Mathias took Stellazine and Cogentin, both used in the treatment of schizophrenia. Police records showed he had become violent on occasion and was charged with assault twice. After his return from Army service in Germany, he would fail to take his drugs and lapse into a disoriented psychosis that usually landed him in a Veterans Administration hospital. "Went haywire," is how Bob, his stepfather, put it.

Ted Weiher was employed for a while as a janitor and snack bar clerk but quit at the urging of his family, who thought Weiher's slowness was causing problems. Jackie Charles Huett, had a slight droop to the head, was sometimes slow to respond and a loving shadow to Weiher, who looked after Huett in a protective sort of way and would dial the phone for him when Hyett had to make a call.

Jack Antone Madruga, a high school graduate and Army veteran, was laid off in November 1977 from his job as a busboy for Sunsweet Growers. William Lee Sterling, was Madruga's special friend and deeply religious, would spend hours at the library reading literature to help bring Jesus to patients in mental hospitals. Gary Dale Mathias, was an assistant in his stepfather's gardening business and an army veteran with psychiatric discharge after drug problems that developed in Germany five years before.

On Friday, February 24th, the five men drove about 50 miles north from Yuba to Chico to attend a college basketball game. When the game ended at the California State University at around 10 pm, they stopped three blocks away at Behr's Market, mildly annoying the clerk (who was trying to close up), and bought one Hostess cherry pie, one Langendorf lemon pie, one Snickers bar, one Marathon bar, two Pepsis and a quart and a half of milk.


The next day when they failed to return from Chico, their families became concerned and called the police.

They were supposed to play a basketball game of their own on February 25, part of a tournament, with a free week in Los Angeles if they won. Their clothes had been laid out the evening of the 24th, before they left for Chico with "Gateway Gators" on them, from the Yuba City vocational rehabilitation centre for the handicapped where they all played basketball. Weiher had asked his mother to wash his new white high-topped sneakers for the tournament saying "We got a big game Saturday. Don't you let me oversleep."

The county sheriffs department began searching for the men. 

On Tuesday, February 28th, a forest ranger found Jack Madruga’s car abandoned the car on an unpaved road near Oroville, in the Rogers Cow camp area, past Elke Retreat, at an elevation of 4,500 feet. The turquoise and white 1969 Mercury Montego was located around a 2.5-hour drive from Chico, in the opposite direction from the route they would have been expected to drive home and way up in the mountains in the Plumas National Forest.

Police found no evidence of foul play at the site of the car, but the car was unlocked, one window was down and the keys were nowhere to be seen. Candy wrappers, milk cartons and basketball programs were in the car but maps were left in the glove compartment. There was no obvious damage to the car, despite the bumpy unmade road, it had around a quarter tank of gas and it was not stuck in the snow. The driver had either used astonishing care and precision, the investigators figured, or else he knew the road well enough to anticipate every rut.

Forest rangers searched the area for five days and found no trace of the men, but soon after the search began, a severe blizzard moved into the area, covering any potential tracks. Around nine inches of snow dropped on the upper mountain. The search teams nearly lost men themselves two days later, as their Snow-cats struggled through the drifts. 


A man called Joseph Schons contacted the police after he heard about the disappearance to say he had seen the men between 11:00–12:00 pm on the Friday that the group disappeared. He was driving up the gravel road to his cabin when his car became stuck in the snow and unfortunately, whilst trying to push his car out, he suffered a heart attack. The story from here is a little confusing. In one version, whilst he lay in his car, at about 11:30, he saw two sets of headlights coming up behind him - one was a car, and the other a pickup truck. He got out of his car to flag them down. The two cars stopped about 20 feet from him. The passengers then left together in one car. Joseph spent the rest of the night in his car before walking back down the mountain in the morning.

In a second more mysterious version, whilst inside the car he heard “whistling” noises and saw what he thought were a group of men and a woman with a baby, walking in the light of another vehicle’s headlights. Schons called for help and the lights turned off and the whistling sounds stopped. A few hours later he saw flashlight beams outside his car and called out for help again, but immediately the lights went out. Schons stayed in his car until it ran out of gas, then walked eight miles down to get help, passing Madruga’s car on the way. He didn’t think much about what he’d seen until he heard about the disappearances.

A woman reported seeing the five men in a red pickup truck on Saturday and Sunday, about an hour’s drive from the site of their abandoned car. She owned a store there, where two of the men came in to buy food. One of them made a phone call from a nearby phone booth, and the other two stayed in the truck.

There was no news for months as the spring snows melted on the mountains. Then, in June 1978, a man riding his motorcycle through the area noticed a broken window on a forest service trailer. The trailer was located about 19 miles up the mountain from where the car was found. 19 miles in heavy snow is quite a hike without proper equipment.

A forest service Snowcat ran up the road to the trailer on February 23rd, leaving a packed path in the snow that the men might have followed.

Inside the trailer, he found the body of Ted Weiher. Search and rescue teams then began combing the area around the trailer.

The day after Weiher's body was discovered, searchers found the remains of Madruga and Sterling. They lay on opposite sides of the road to the trailer, 11.4 miles from the car. Madruga had been partially eaten by animals and dragged about 10 feet to a stream: he lay face up, his right hand curled around his watch. Sterling was in a wooded area, scattered over about 50 feet. There was nothing left of him but bones.

Two days later, just off the same road but much closer to the trailer, Jackie Huett's father found his son's backbone along with a pair of Levis and ripple-soled "Get There’s" shoes. An assistant sheriff from Plumas County found a skull the next day, about 100 yards downhill from the rest of the bones which the family dentist used to identify the remains.

Huett's remains were located northeast of the trailer, like Sterling's and Madruga's. Northwest of the trailer, about a quarter mile away, searchers found three wool forest service blankets and a two-cell flashlight lying by the side of the road. The flashlight was slightly rusted and had been turned off. It was impossible to tell just how long it had been there.

They found no sign of Gary Mathias. His tennis shoes were inside the forest service trailer, which suggested to investigators that he might have taken them off to put on Weiher's leather shoes - particularly since Weiher had bigger feet, and Mathias' feet might have swollen with frostbite. 

Although the men’s bodies were heavily decomposed, autopsy results determined that they had likely died from exposure.

It appeared that Ted had lived 8-13 weeks after his disappearance based on the length of his beard and around 100 pound weight loss. He weighed just 120 pounds at the time of his death. Several bed sheets in a shroud were tightly tucked over his body, indicating that someone else had been with him in the trailer as he could not have bundled himself up in this manner. His leather shoes were off and missing. A table by the bed held his nickel ring with "Ted" engraved on it, his gold necklace, his wallet (with cash inside) and a gold Waltham watch, its crystal missing, which the families say had not belonged to any of the five men. Ted's feet were also badly frostbitten.

But then the story takes an even stranger turn. Inside the trailer, authorities found heavy clothing, matches, playing cards, books, wooden furniture, and other materials which could have easily been used to start a fire. But there had been no apparent attempt to start a fire despite the freezing temperature on the mountain. A propane tank connected to the trailer, which could have provided a ready source of heat and cooking fuel, was untouched. "All they had to do was turn that gas on," says Yuba County Lt. Lance Ayers, "and they'd have had gas to the trailer, and heat."

In a storage shed outside, there was a year’s supply of c-rations. These were individual canned, pre-cooked, and prepared meals issued to the U.S. military. The men consumed 36 of the meals but left the majority of them untouched. In addition, there was a huge supply of freeze-dried meals. One of the c-ration cans had been opened with an Army P38 can opener.

"Bizarre," says John Thompson, the special agent from the California Department of Justice who had joined the investigation. "And no explanations. And a thousand leads. Every day you've got a thousand leads."

"There was some force that made em go up there." Jack Madruga's mother Mabel says firmly. "They wouldn't have fled off in the wood like a bunch of quail. We know good and well that somebody made them do it. We can't visualize someone getting the upper hand on those five men, but we know it must have been." "They seen something at that game, at the parking lot," says Ted Weiher's sister-in-law. "They might have seen it and didn't even realize they seen it."

2020-11-15 07:11:33 : I slept with my best friend and want to date her exclusively, but have no idea how to broach the topic : throwrafuckimnervous : https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/juhyty/i_slept_with_my_best_friend_and_want_to_date_her/

TW perhaps: graphic-ish sexual details

  My best friend Lily (29F) and I (29M) have been friends since diaper days.  Our moms were best friends, so we spent a LOT of time together and I’ve honestly probably been lowkey in love with her since I was 13 - I’ve asked her out a few times in our youth, the last time being maybe when we were 18 but she’s always declined, saying that she didn’t want to ruin what we have but genuinely wanted to remain friends.  I agreed and we have remained the best of friends ever since.  We have both been single for a little bit now. 

  I ended up studying abroad for the majority of my 20s.  We hung out whenever I came back to visit, which wasn’t very often.  We haven’t seen each other in about 6 years, though we still talk pretty often.  I moved back recently, but we hadn’t gotten to get together yet.  Last night, I linked up with some friends and we went to a small party.  Lo and behold, Lily is there!  We were both ecstatic to see each other and spent most of the evening talking and catching up.  After a couple of drinks, I sort of tested the waters and hinted at her coming home with me, and she happily agreed.  I was a little surprised because I felt like I was definitely being flirty, but since we’re so close I thought maybe she just assumed it was innocent and I’m just really bad at giving signals.  It isn’t unusual for us to spend nights at each other’s homes, after all.

  We got to my place and were watching some casual TV and chatting, and we got onto the topic of how long it’s been since we’ve seen each other and how much we’ve changed.  I told her that she looked amazing and we joked about both of us “glowing up” and whatnot, and to my surprise because she never really compliments my appearance, she said that I also looked great and that she loved how “big” I’ve gotten (I used to be a skinny little beanpole).  I said something along the lines of “yeah? You like what you see?” And she said yes, and the next thing I knew, we were furiously making out with her straddled on top of me.  It got extremely heated and we ended up having the most mind-blowing sex I could have ever imagined all over my living room...  It was.... intense.  I told her I loved her and she said she loved me too.  I asked her to move in with me and she said she would love to.  She told me over and over how hot I was, how good I was, how she’s wanted to do this forever.  These things were said while we were actively fucking though, and I have no idea if it was just primal drunken shit or if she really meant any of it. I definitely did.  I was on cloud nine. 

  This morning, she made me breakfast (not unusual) and she acted as if nothing happened at all.... she chatted about work and said she was so glad we ran into each other, and then just got ready for work and left.  We’ve texted a few times today but it’s been our normal shit. I, on the other hand, have been so nauseated with anxiety about where this could go that I have been bed ridden all fucking day.

   I don’t want to fuck this up.  I really really do love this woman.  She’s my dream girl.  She’s smart, successful, funny, compassionate, supportive... I don’t want to fuck this up and I really want to take this to the next level.  She’s rejected me before (albeit a decade ago and definitely never after a passionate night of lovemaking), and I’m terrified of her rejecting me again after this.  I am being an absolute coward and I know it. But.... Reddit, what the fuck do I do?  How do I approach this topic with her?  What should I say?  Am I reading into things too much?  I feel genuinely sick to my stomach lol

2020-11-15 07:12:56 : Hopeless and anxious : cantordustbunnies : https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/juhzbx/hopeless_and_anxious/

This is essentially a rant but I would really appreciate someone reading this and trying to give me advice. I'm a 26 year old male and live at home. I don't believe I'm capable of finding or maintaining a romantic relationship and will never have one.  I have huge amounts of stress in regards to finding work and I still don't drive because I'm so afraid of being behind the wheel. I've worked in the past though and hated it to be honest. I've done two different 4 month to half a year courses trying to get a certificate in something so I can try to find a work environment that isn't so abusive and disrespectful like fast food or retail. 

I finished one but found the practicum to be so stressful that I was hospitalized and never wanted to work in the field ever again, and didn't finish the other one because I was hospitalized due to mental health in the middle of doing its practicum. Now I'm doing a third course and I think I can handle the practicum better this time and think I will be actually able to work in the field. It just stresses me out because I can tell this course like all the others is not preparing us in the least for working at the job and the "education" is laughable and basically nonexistent.

I'm just so sick of how false and stressful the vast majority of things in life are. Higher education like University is a joke and doesn't give you anything useful and actually cripples you with debt unless if you go into a very specific field and a very determined. Lower education like the community college stuff I'm doing is still crap and in my experience of now doing 3 different courses at 3 different places has shown me that it's very typical for everything they teach you to be around 10 years out of date and that you're expected to have to throw out everything you've "learned" and re-learn everything on your practicum. 

To make things worse the people who you have to work alongside on your practicum are usually totally disinterested in helping you learn as a student and expect you to be totally work ready and expect that they'll have a few weeks off and that they'll let the student work for them. You have to be totally over confident and pretend like you know what you're doing or else the clients you work for will rip you apart and yet you're totally vulnerable and you're a student. It seems like life is designed to benefit arrogant sh\* heads who aren't intelligent enough to doubt their own abilities and who don't really care if they do a good job or not.

I see the world disintegrating around me, at least when it comes to my country of Canada. There's nothing I want to work towards. I feel abandoned by my own country and that what's best for it's native population has been traded for temporary profit by those in power. I don't like or want to be apart of wider society or be with people in general who I find to be totally untrustworthy and who are cruel without even realizing it. I'm homosexual, and the "gay community" which I'm supposedly supposed to feel apart of and welcomed by is toxic, superficial and alienating.

I've tried accessing mental health help for over a decade now and time and time again I am just met with bureaucratic "professionals" who seem to be only able to speak in platitudes and offer trite and generic advice if they offer advice at all in-between shelling out pills that don't work. I'm so sick of the "mindfulness" approach that is so in vogue right now. I'm convinced that the whole push towards accepting "mindfulness" is an artificially crafted psy-op designed to keep the population as docile and sheep-like as possible. I find it disturbing that so much in current psychology is designed to get people to distract themselves from their own emotions and  their own perceptions and their own critical thought and to just \~live in the moment\~, because society is so messed up right now heaven forbid people actually think to start fighting against it or fighting against the globalist agenda.

I'm so sick of having these therapists and counsellors try to shove crap like yoga or meditation down my throat as well. Why is it that they can acknowledge pushing stuff like prayer isn't okay but they feel fine pushing eastern spiritual rituals, albeit a sanitized and secular version of them? I don't feel the need to live my life with any kind of spirituality and get so frustrated when they refuse to listen that I'm not interested in crap like "meditation." I don't care if there have been studies that apparently show it works, I'm sure stuff like animal sacrifice would work towards calming your state of mind as well. That's the whole point of religious rituals.  

I'm just so sick of everything, I trust nothing. At every turn governmental institutions and corporations alike are manipulating and lying to everyone and trying to get away with as much as possible, all the while putting on a saccharine and cutesy mask. And people eat it all up. I feel miserable, I'm ugly, I feel like things are hopelessly corrupt.  I'm constantly stressed out and have social anxiety.

 I feel pressured to be confident and get out there and be assertive and make money when I feel like the least confident person in the world and all I wanna do is die and have it be over. Even if I did have tons of money there's nothing I want to spend it on. You have to be so fake to survive it seems, it seems like there's actually a premium placed upon how well you can fake things but I can see the falsity everywhere and it sickens me. You have to have tons of motivation and tons of self confidence to make it anywhere and yet how do I drum up that motivation when the society I live in is mentally ill and sick itself? How do I drum up the motivation to survive and to deal with crappy work and crappy school when the reward is in itself a punishment? I feel totally lazy and that I'm mooching off of my mom which is a horrible feeling but the feeling of forcing myself out there is in many ways worse and yet I continue to try and be more independent.

I try to surround myself with beauty, with works of art, with things I like, with the awe of mathematics, with nature - but I'm currently not able to be sustained emotionally by these things. I don't know what I'll ever be sustained by. I'm alive right now because I don't want to hurt my mother by dying prematurely and I'm just living for her. I feel utterly alone, scared, and unhappy, and I have no idea where to turn, I don't see things getting better, I don't see any sources out there that can help me.

Hey there! Hope everyone's doing fine. Just thought I'd see if I could look for help on here. Im a 21 year old male (170lbs 5'11"). I've had a persistent cough for about 10 months now. At times its hardly even noticeable/goes away for a day or two and at other times its deep within my chest, phlegmy and painful. About two months ago the lymph nodes on each side of my neck above my collar bone were noticeably swollen but not extremely large. They're very mobile and seem to fluctuate slightly in size and amount of nodes in the area. Other issues in that area of the lymph node: Jaw feels swollen and under pressure at times, especially when eating. Occasional right ear pain and moisture in the ear. Other potential related issues: increase in body temperature simular to hot flashes, these occur at random times. Sometimes I wake up and night incredible hot but not sweaty. I've had a rash on my inner thighs for about 2 weeks now, very itchy, along with what appear to be purple stretch marks. I take medication for IBS and acid reflux. I have moderate to severe anxiety. I've had a doctor examine the lymph nodes, they were determined to be not too swollen and not a concern. I feel generally unwell quite a bit. 

Any help would be terrific.

Thank you!

2020-11-15 07:13:33 : Playing Chess while stoned? : TeddyAnneman : https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/juhzku/playing_chess_while_stoned/

Anyone ever play Chess while stoned, other than you, Elizabeth Harmon?

I recently played several games while pretty well stoned and the board was really easy to see. It was quite extraordinary. The board just looked so simple. I was winning 1-minute games (800 range). 

It kind of astounded me, I'd think being impaired akin to being drunk would make the game impossible. 

I'm not advocating any life style, but it was quite interesting. The board looked differently, very simple.

2020-11-15 07:13:33 : I’m having the worst two months of my life : sentimentalbean : https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/juhzkn/im_having_the_worst_two_months_of_my_life/

First I got whooping cough. Next, my longterm boyfriend completely ghosted me out of the blue after weeks earlier telling me he wanted to marry me (still haven’t heard from him, probably never will again). 

I then found out (at 21) that I am infertile. One of my life’s goals was to be a mother, and I honestly still can’t believe it. I’m also yet to figure out how to tell my mum, who’s already knit a baby blanket for my future kids. 

Then I got put on a medication that put me in hospital with serotonin syndrome. So we changed to a different medication, and that made me so nauseous I vomited for 3 days straight, landing me in the hospital for a second time round needing an IV bag. (The nausea’s gone down, but only by about 20%. Almost a month later I’m still vomiting out of the blue some days.)

In between all this my laptop got broken and is gonna cost a bomb to fix. I worked my ass off to graduate with an A GPA and still didn’t get into the postgrad course I need to do the job I want, so now I have to take a gap year (and it’s COVID times, so can’t even spend it travelling and “soul searching”). 

I’ve also gained about 10kg in an incredibly short amount of time, which I normally wouldn’t care about but literally none of my clothes fit me anymore. And it sounds ridiculous, but tonight my Nintendo Switch broke too and that was the last straw. It just feels like every day something new and shitty happens and I’m exhausted.

I know other people have it so much worse, and I’m grateful for the things I do have. But it’s also hard to imagine this string of bad luck and bad news ever ending. I look back to where I was a year ago vs. now where I’m alone, very fat, and completely aimless with no idea what I’m going to do next year.

2020-11-15 07:13:25 : Love life situation : JauneOG : https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/juhzin/love_life_situation/

So this is going to be a long one. It's clearly about my romantic and sexual life.   
Right now I am a 19 year old male, currently living in Canada  
In my current situation there is 3 girls. Girl A \[Age 19\], Girl B \[Age 20\], Girl C \[Age 16\]. My relationship with these 3 different girls are all complicated and none of them know about each other. 

Girl A is like my perfect girl, everything I would want in a future wife. The issue is that she moved halfway across the country for her dream work / school which makes a relationship kind of difficult to have. But even with that I think about her everyday and no matter how hard I try to move past my feelings or ignore them, I just can't shake my feelings for her. If she was here I would easily be in love with her and even now I believe I'm close to that. So I don't know what to do about my relationship with her, and my feelings for her. (Should also mention I also plan to move to the same place for the same job \[we had the same dream job before knowing each other\] sometime in the next few months)

Girl B is probably the most complicated of the three. We met a few years ago in school, both single at the time, and didn't think much of her. Then I got to know her way better because, drumroll, she started dating my best friend, since birth \[Call him friend A\]. They dated for a while and he eventually broke up with her. But we had become friends so we kept talking a little bit just as friends. She eventually moved into an apartment with a different friend of mine \[Call him friend B\]. They were just moving in as friends. Time goes on and eventually somehow we end up being FWB. Being FWB goes on for a while before I learn that friend B was apparently in love with her and she did not reciprocate and since I am now having sex with Girl B, Friend B hates me now. Then very soon after, Girl B tells me that she's in love with me. We talk about a relationship and how it probably wouldn't work because of all the ppl involved. Not long after this COVID starts and other stuff happens in my life and I decide to take a mental health break from everyone. Just be with myself for a while. But, while having good intentions, the execution of this was bad. I never told anyone that I was going to stop talking to them for a while including Girl B. Obviously this really hurts her when I stop talking to her with no explanation. A few months go by and I'm in a better spot now and start talking to people, explaining everything. I tell Girl B and she takes it really well saying she's still pissed but she understands everything and forgives me. At this point obv no longer FWB but even now we haven't even mentioned the fact we used to do anything with each other but yet there is still a sexual tension between us. Now when we hang out as friends I can't help the fact I still have these romantic and sexual feelings for her, and they're pretty strong. Everytime we are together I want to cuddle be more intimate like we used to. I think there is a chance she feels the same way but also a chance that I'm just wrong and if so I don't want to make her uncomfortable as she has a bad history with this sort of thing.

Girl C is the newest relationship of the three girls. She is the cousin of my best friends girlfriend, they introduced us at the beginning of the summer and at this time I didn't know her age but there was a very clear and strong sexual tension between us the second we met. Her cousin (aka my friends girlfriend) told me that she likes me and I kind of pursued that avenue to see where it went. Since then  , btw this is about to get a bit NSFW, we haven't had sex yet but we have kissed and cuddled and slept in the same bed overnight and I have done hand stuff to her southern regions if you know what I mean. Anyways the issue with her is we don't have too much in common in my eyes and shes really young but I didn't learn that until we had already done stuff so it can't really be a dealbreaker anymore. I could never see myself marrying her tbh. BUT the issue is she has strong feelings for me, way stronger than I have for her, and I really don't want to hurt her because she has a really really bad past with guys. Her family is very complicated and I know this sounds bad but that's not something I can really take in my current mental state with a girlfriend. So there's multiple reasons to not date her and out of the three girls I have the least feelings for her but she has the most for me (That I am aware of.)

IN Conclusion I don't know who I should pursue. If Girl A was here it would be her hands down but she's not and I haven't even seen her in over a year. I do have strong feelings for Girl B but I've hurt her and don't know if I should try again with her. and finally Girl C would be a sure thing for me but we don't connect as well in my opinion but her feelings for me are strong and I don't want to hurt her at all. What do you think I should do?

2020-11-15 07:13:58 : In the process of getting properly diagnosed. What are some things I can bring up when I see the doctor? : rebeccalaurenx : https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/juhzqk/in_the_process_of_getting_properly_diagnosed_what/

I was diagnosed with IBS when I was 21 (I am 27 now) however this was after pressuring my doctor to give me a colonoscopy. After the procedure he saw no polyps or ulcers, and it seemed like I had a teeny bit of inflammation. But all he said was “you probably have IBS, take fiber supplements, drink more water and eat non-trigger foods” and sent me on my merry way. 

I never ended up doing those things too hardcore, because even though I had pretty bad stomach problems, I ended up just smoking marijuana a lot and it seemed to solve the issue. My symptoms back then,  were pretty low grade and honestly not that bad. I’d get gassy, nausea, etc. I felt it was more anxiety related and didn’t think about it too seriously. 

Now I’m older, and this week, has been a constant flare up. Of course, I also happened to quit smoking marijuana. I have been feeling sick this entire week. 
Last Friday, I woke up at 1am with acid reflux / vomiting. And ever since then my stomach has been upset and I can’t eat really anything at all without having diarrhea. I can eat potatoes &amp; eggs for breakfast, jello or applesauce or something gentle for lunch but then dinner rolls around and every thing I eat for dinner just leaves my body, like tonight I had some homemade salmon onigiri and of course, within about 2 hours, it completely fell out of my asshole. Lmao. I felt nauseous immediately after eating, and after it was fully disgusted, I had diarrhea. This week, I have had diarrhea about 3-4 times. This is the most I have EVER had diarrhea in a single week. 
When I was smoking - I was often times constipated and now it’s the exact opposite and nothing seems to stay solid anymore. I also am unable to eat as much, so I am noticing weight loss. 
When I was smoking - I would wake up and feel gassy, sick, and overly full. Now that I’m not, I’m waking up empty and feeling actually ok and not nauseous however, the hunger eventually comes and then I eventually do feel nauseous anyway. 

I have an over the phone appointment on the 16th and I am requesting a referral for a full blood panel and then a referral for a GI specialist because I think this has developed into something more. 
But is there anything I should specifically ask the doctor for? Maybe a medication that would help me stop having diarrhea in the mean time until I can see the GI specialist? 

What should I request from my doctor? 
I’ve already gone the colonoscopy route but I’m not sure if now that’s it’s been about 7 years if it is a good idea to go through all of that again or not. Or if I would be better off asking for specific blood tests? 
Should I also be tested for endo? I see some folks saying here that they ALSO have endometriosis which I have thought I have had for the last 4 years. (I don’t have a period at all, unless I’m on the pill.) 

I would love whatever suggestions this group has. Though this isn’t new to me I really want to seriously solve this problem I just don’t know what to ask for.
Thank you.

I am a medical student who also works on coding projects in my free time. I built an eHealth application called "New Leaf" for managing your blood pressure without a doctors visit. The application is going to record when you take medications using smart pill bottles, update your BP automatically using a wireless cuff, and allow you to track food/exercise data while updating your doctor. If anyone can look over my website or even try out the application it would be awesome.

I need a little input, Ive already setup open core and have a working mac os environment (besides sound I need to figure that out haven't had time) on a spare drive. I want to run a virtual machine on my linux install, that would have support for two monitors(I have an Intel gpu and a dedicated nvidia so I don't care about the dedicated as long as I can actually use my main monitor). What would be the best way about going about this? ( I currently have big sur installed and it would be cool if I didn't have to do much since I already got it all setup). Primarily, I'm asking for what vm software you guys would recommend (obviously able to run on linux), and how I should go about converting my already working physical setup to a virtual one.

I noticed that the notes in my iphone and notes in my macbook had different content despite using iCloud. 

On my macbook I synced my icloud notes thinking that the two group (iphone notes and macbook notes) of notes would merge. I did this by Notes&gt;Accounts&gt; iCloud&gt; selecting Notes (initially it was unchecked). When I selected/ticked Notes all my notes on my macbook disappeared. And all my iPhone notes were on my macbook. I tried unticking the Notes box thinking my macbook notes would come back but it was just empty. 

Has anyone else experienced this? Any suggestions on how can I recover the notes on my macbook that disappeared? ( I do not have timemachine)

(Macbook pro mid 2012 13" on macOS Catalina and iPhone 6s on ios14)

Thanks

2020-11-15 07:14:37 : Found out my husband had been texting some girl : Wicked-Minded : https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/jui019/found_out_my_husband_had_been_texting_some_girl/

So background: i (27f) have been married to (23M) for 1 year but been together for 3 (since june 2017)
Our life has been rocky to say the least, but we've held on for the best and we are now in a good place. We have a gorgeous 1 year old baby girl that i wouldnt trade for the world. 
When i got pregos 2 decembers ago, he started acting funny. By that i mean, completely detached. Hed avoid me like how someone should avoid a plague. Hed work late everyday n wouldnt come home until i was asleep. Since i worked mornings, there was no line of communication between us literally the whole pregnancy. But honestly i still tried, i placed my best effort in and felt like i was fighting an uphill battle. (Things didnt work out for the best until recently tbh, but different story)
After my baby girl was born i honestly had a mental check and completely checked out of my relationship too. I even stopped caring for myself (couldve been post partum but tbh i never got checked) and i focused on my baby and work. 
One rare night i grabbed his phone and low and behold i found texts between him and some girl hed been messaging when we were dating...like 7 months before we got married. 
I didnt know how to react. I was mad..livid. but honestly i didnt fight it too much. I was angry and screamed, demanded to know who she was. Apparently no one (eye roll) and did notice hed blocked her but not before getting her number. He had started texting her first. I read the messages and he was thirsting over her first. Thing is...when he messaged her, he was in his home country visiting. So the chance that he had sex with her are HIGH. He texted her 3 days before coming back home. Right after coming back home, he insisted on moving in with me and marrying. After a few months we had eloped and i didnt find anything out until my baby was 6 months. 
He apologized but said it was nothing and honestly has done nothing to win my trust back. Just expects me to know he didnt cheat and trust him. Its been a LONG time since i found out...but i cant get over it. He has since then removed his ig and fb accounts off of my phone (i should trust him and not check in on his pages) and i know he keeps in contact with girls from his country (allegedly friends from high school) and insists i shouldnt be mad or anything because hes known them since high school and never messaged that girl ever again. Thing is, i dont know who she is or if thats true. Im honestly in a bad place still about it and i dont know how to get over it..any advice is appreciated:)

2020-11-15 07:14:35 : 1 week post - op Intralase SBK (all - laser LASIK) from Lasik MD vancouver : Thrive92 : https://www.reddit.com/r/lasik/comments/jui00y/1_week_post_op_intralase_sbk_all_laser_lasik_from/

Hello everyone! I was thinking of making this post a bit later when my eyes have healed a little more, but I think aside from a few side effects, my recovery has been relatively stable. I did my surgery on November 7th, so it has been exactly a week since my surgery. I wanted to share my experience especially to those who are considering lasik in Vancouver.

**Location:** Lasik MD (Vancouver downtown) \*\*This is not sponsored by Lasik MD!

**Price:** $3630 CAD for the Advanced Custom Wavefront All - Laser LASIK (It was originally $3980 with the lifetime enhancement plan, but I was able to get $350 off from my school insurance).

**Prescription:**  I was not given much information about my eyes after the consultation. I had to ask them, and the technician told me that I had around -10 prescription for each eyes (yikes!). They did not tell me my corneal thickness, but since I was super anxious about the surgery, I foolishly forgot to ask.

I have been considering lasik eye surgery for years now, and I finally decided to take the risk this year. I had initially consulted with another lasik eye surgery place, but after an administrative mix up where they set my appointment for a PRK surgery instead of Intralase SBK (all - laser lasik), I was having doubts with the place. Once they told me that I would have to wait until late December to get intralase SBK done instead of early November which was my initial surgery date, I decided to give up my surgery deposit and go to Lasik MD.

I was booked for consultation and surgery (both are done in one sitting due to COVID - 19 restrictions) for mid - November. As I grew anxious and impatient about waiting that long, I decided to give them a call a few days later to see if any earlier surgery dates have opened up. I got lucky and got an appointment a week earlier! If you are like me and is determined to have the surgery, I would advise you all to call them after a few days of making the initial appointment. There are many people who get cold feet and change their minds a day or two before their appointments. Try not to call frequently, as you may burden or annoy them. I realized shortly after the second time I have called that the people who make the initial appointments are not from the clinic offices, but instead are solely responsible for setting up appointments for Lasik MD clinics, no matter where you are. You won't be bothering any one person in specific, as a different representative pick up every time you would call.

**Consultation/Surgery:** The clinic took good precautions for the pandemic by taking everyone's temperature (with a gun - like device) and making sure everyone is spaced out in the main waiting area. You would have to wash your hands from an alcohol handwashing station that is placed right as you walk into the main door of the clinic. A staff member then walks with you to sanitize the chair in the waiting area a cleaning solution and cloth before you sit down.

You are first brought to a technician that would check your eyes with four different machines. This isn't so much to check your prescription, but I think it is more likely to see if your eyes have any serious problems with it. It takes no longer than 10 minutes. Afterwards, you are brought to an optometrist to check your prescription, the dryness of your eyes and your corneal thickness. The optometrist puts in some yellow - dyed eye drops into your eyes to make the dry spots more visible, and noted that I have dry eye issues. She recommended intralase SBK (all - laser lasik) in order to save as much corneal tissue as possible and to mitigate dry eye issues post - surgery. Since that was what I was going to choose in the first place, I agreed to go with the SBK.

The scary part was when she said that since my prescription is so high, there is a 25 - 30% chance that my eyesight may regress. I didn't think the chances of regression would be that bad, but since I was planning on getting the lifetime vision enhancement plan anyways, it didn't bother me as much.

After that, you are seated again and given disclaimer forms to sign and initial. Then you are brought into a room where they would discuss and accept the payment, discuss vision enhancement options, give you sunglasses and the instructions to wear them, and confirm your 24 - hour follow up appointment. They already mention this to you by email, but make sure that your debit card is able to do the transaction. Some bank accounts may not allow a single transaction of thousands of dollars. They also mention that if you cannot make it to the 24 - hour follow up appointment, the surgery would have to be rescheduled as it is very important.

At this point, my phone battery died and so I was just staring at a wall for about an hour and a half. The waiting time is absolutely brutal; I think I spent five hours in the clinic that day. The staff member that greets you when you enter the clinic mentions that you will be spending at least three to five hours, and this is because of the pandemic and the fact that the consultation and the surgery must be on the same day. I tried asking some staff members if they had a charger for an iphone like a dweeb who wasn't prepared for the wait time, but sadly none of them did.

I was then brought to a dimly - lit room, and a staff member put in two numbing drops into each of my eyes. After a few minutes of waiting, I was brought into the operating room where I met Doctor Boudreault, the surgeon. No anxiety medication was given, but they did give me two stress balls. There was a rotating reclined seat that you lie down on, and then the doctor puts in a ton of liquid solution in your eyes. You are then swiveled below the machine that creates the corneal flaps with the femtosecond laser.

They put clamps and tools on your eye that would prevent you from closing it or moving your cornea, and then the machine would do its thing while the doctor talks to you and counts down the seconds until I can move again. The pressure that these clamps put on your eyes are by far the most uncomfortable things that I have experienced during the entire surgery. It felt like your eyes are just on the verge of popping out. The femtosecond laser machine then drops closer to you until it feels like it is almost touching your eye, and then it does its magic. The lasers do not hurt at all.

The left eye went without a hitch, but the clamp for the right eye seemed to have some trouble, as I noticed the doctor putting it away from my eye and informing the assistant for a different one. During the few seconds that we were waiting for the clamp, he started to impatiently tap his foot on the floor. I get that I am just two of the many eyes that he had done surgery on today, but it's those little things that makes my social anxiety flare up and contemplate just running out of the room.

Once the flaps are made, which takes no longer than thirty seconds for each eye, the chair is then swiveled to the right, under the excimer laser machine. The doctor then opens the corneal flap with a tool, and tells me to look at a red light, which had smaller green lights on its sides. The machine starts, and the red/green lights start fluctuating in size and in sharpness; this is where I started to smell burnt hair. I thought I was ready for the odor, but it was so strong and so sudden that it caught me by surprise. Worse yet, the smell clings onto your hair, and won't go away until you wash it the next day.

The excimer laser machine takes no longer than a minute for each eye, and then the doctor puts in liquid solution in your eyes, puts the flap back, soothes it with a tool, puts in bandage contact lenses, and then you are done! You are then brought to the optometrist again where she does a quick check up of your eyes, provides you your prescription for eye drops, and you are on your way.

**Post - Op day 1:** Almost immediately I can notice that I can see! It was very blurry, but so much better than where I was prior to the surgery. I walk to the nearby london drugs to get my prescription, and then I catch a taxi to drive me back home in Burnaby. I had to wear the sunglasses that were provided to me for 24 hours, both inside and outside my home. Despite the fact that it was uncomfortable, I was so sensitive to light after the first few hours of the operation that I would have trouble opening my eyes without the shades. I also had to wear them while I was sleeping in order to prevent myself from rubbing my eyes. Since I never wore contact lenses before, the bandage contact lenses were uncomfortable, and I definitely had trouble going to sleep that night with the shades and the contacts and the burnt hair smell of the laser that is stuck on my hair...yuck. There was no pain, just mild irritation and discomfort. The "foreign body" sensation was pretty strong. I noticed some very minor halos around the lights in my home, but they were so minor that it did not bother me. My eyes felt pretty dry, which I was expecting since I had dry eyes even before the surgery. I put in the drops prescribed to me, and managed to fall asleep.

**Post - Op day 2:** I woke up to find the sunglasses neatly folded beside me. Boom! more anxiety from the sudden thoughts of "did i touch my eyes in my sleep??" Thankfully, I felt no worse than before I went to sleep, so I shook off the feeling. My 24 - hour follow up appointment was at 8:30am, where a different optometrist took off my bandage contact lenses, and checked my prescription. While my left eye was seeing 20/30, my right eye was having some issues with blurriness. She told me to take Maxidex (corticosteroid eye drop prescribed to me) once every two hours instead of the instructed four, and set up another follow up appointment. I had asked if it was okay to do the follow up over the phone, and she reluctantly agreed. The feeling without those bandage lenses was incredible! There was no major discomfort or irritation in my eyes, but the dry eyes were still kind of bothering me. There was also a strange feeling of a small pebble or an eyelash being stuck on my left eye, but this is also expected shortly after surgery. The dry eyes aren't too bad during the daytime. However, during the night, I can barely keep my eyes open. Although the feeling of an eyelash being stuck to my eye went away after day 5, the dry eyes still bother me to this day (day 7), especially during the night.

**Post - Op day 3:**  I noticed that my Maxidex eye drop was running out. As someone who had never used eye drops before, I would often miss my eye when using the drops. Even when it would land on my eye, I had this off - putting feeling that not all of the drop went in, so I would use the eye drop more than once. Please do not do this, as I had to call the lasik md emergency line to get my prescription renewed. This was a Monday, and so the clinic was closed for the day. I bothered a poor staff member (who I could clearly hear from the background that she was at home) to come to the office and make arrangements with the london drugs pharmacy for me to pick up a new prescription. I felt worse than I did during my recovery process :( She was super nice about it too, which made me feel even more awful. I had to get an uber to drive to the pharmacy again, pick up the eye drops, and come back. I also noticed that whenever I would put in my Maxidex drops, my left eye would sting a bit. This feeling went away after a couple of days.

**Post - Op day 4 - 5:**  This was the day where I had the follow - up phone appointment. I informed the optometrist that my right eye is still blurry compared to my left eye, and so I was told to come in person the next day. Unfortunately, this was also when the province had more than 500 confirmed daily cases of COVID - 19, and so I was very reluctant to come in person. As I live with my mother who is in her sixties (and so she is more vulnerable to the virus), it took alot of convincing from the optometrist for me to come in. It wasn't until the optometrist told me over the phone that I would have to come in for the sake of my vision that I took the plunge. There was also an ICBC licensing office nearby, so I made an appointment online to change my driver's license eyeglasses restriction an hour prior to the lasik MD appointment. I figured that if I am going outside anyways, I might as well make the most out of it.

I am glad that I went into the follow up - appointment, because the optometrist noticed that my right eye is still very swollen, which explains the slow healing time compared to my other eye. She said that although it is not too bad, it may be required for the doctor to re-open the corneal flap and "clean" the eye with some solution. That means the healing time will reset for my right eye; no driving back home and having to sleep with sunglasses on for another whole night. Thankfully, it never came to that, as the surgeon used a tool to brush my eye, which apparently worked! The optometrist checked my prescription, and told me that both my eyes are 20/25 now, with my right eye missing a few letters on the projector. Wooo! I was able to drive back home instead of getting an uber or a taxi yet again, which was getting expensive. The optometrist told me that I should use my prescription eye drops again just for this last day, which I did. I definitely noticed the halos from car headlights on my way home, but they were hardly a bother.

**Post - Op day 6 - 7:** I have noticed during the past two days that I would wake up to blurred vision and stinging dry eyes. Although I am glad that I am not suffering from severe dry eyes that would force me to wake up in the middle of the night due to the pain, this was still annoying. It would take about an hour and several rounds of artificial tear drops for my vision to become sharp again. Hopefully this is temporary, but I think that perhaps this may be because I stopped using the prescription eye drops (zymar and maxidex).

Other than the dryness, everything is great. After the last appointment where the doctor did his magic on my right eye, I'm starting to notice the blurriness slowly going away. It's still not as sharp as my left eye, which is my dominant eye thankfully, but I sense that it is still recovering. I still use the artificial tear drops on an hourly basis ever since the first day of surgery, and this is because I use my computer alot for school and I had dry eyes even prior to the surgery. Even if my eyes don't feel dry, I would use them every hour. I am very glad and grateful that the only side effects that bothers me is the dry eyes. I felt like I dodged multiple bullets, including severe halos, starbursts, eye floaters, etc... I hope anyone who is suffering from these severe side effects from the surgery a speedy recovery. Please do not give up!

Please feel free to ask me any questions! I will be more than happy to answer them.

2020-11-15 07:15:18 : My friend can’t date but her and this dude basically act like a married couple? : tadefengshui : https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/jui0al/my_friend_cant_date_but_her_and_this_dude/

This will probably be long and confusing but I wanna give advice to my friend  but idk what the right words are I guess.

So my friend and this guy have been talking every day for close to a year and they obviously like each other but it gets complicated with her religion. She has to marry someone with her religion and he’s not part of it. Her culture is really strict with this sort of thing so she can’t really “date”. 

In the past she has said things like I wouldn’t date someone we would just get engaged straight away via getting set up by her parents. She always say she doesn’t know what to do because she doesn’t want to date him but she does at the same time. He knows that her culture is a barrier but he still talks to her and they talk openly about their feelings and future endeavors. 

I try to get her to think logically and ask questions like “do you see a future with him” “would you actually date him” things like that and she always says she’s not sure. I’ve told her that she’s kinda leading this guy on but he’s aware of all these obstacles and still chooses to talk with her. He’s even said that he would convert to her religion in the past. We’re still pretty young tho (all 19). But I think in her culture people get married earlier.

They really like each other but my friend is always confused with what she should do and is always asking for advice. I want to push her in the right direction but I don’t know the answer or what I could say.

Certain counties have temples as the county capital, meaning that the county has to be held by a bishop if your faith has theocratic clergy (like, say, catholic).

Lots of them in central germany like mainz, paderborn and osnabruck.

Cities are obviously supposed to be held by low born mayors and castles by nobles. But you cant grant them to your bishop under theocratic clergy. Are you supposed to pick a random person? Seems weird.

2020-11-15 07:16:06 : True definition of cat diagnosis : teeuhmama : https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/jui0kj/true_definition_of_cat_diagnosis/

I have a 9 yr Old Male Grey tabby. 
He has tumors in his mouth, The vet said it was a bad infection with a inflammation response. 
However, my cat has been sick for 2 yrs. I’ve gone to 5 different vets over that time. I had stool samples, full dental twice, without 1 bad tooth each time. Blood work that got thrown away. 

After that, over the last 3 months he’s received first, only antibiotics convenia. After no improvement he was prescribed steroid tabs 5mg. The steroids had a negative effect. I scheduled a biopsy and full dental, to remove any bad teeth. The vet called in the middle of his surgery and said it was serve cancer and he may not make it, if I would like her to preform resuscitation. When I pick up my cat she says 2 masses were removed and a tooth came out w one but she did not perform the full dental. I call the next week for his results. The Dr. says it’s not cancer. It’s a bad infection w inflammation and to continue the same treatment plan injections. Another option would be tooth extraction but they don’t do that and id have to find another vet. That didn’t make any sense to me, so I called back the next day to get the name of his diagnosis and spoke to the receptionist. She had to spell out his diagnosis for me because it was so extreme.

“plasmacytic/ supportive, diffuse, severe, extensively ulcerate with regional submucosal osseous metaplasia” 

She then said if I’m able to understand medical terms and know what that is than awesome but personally she does not and the dr would have to call me back. 
But they won’t call me back. 

I’m very frustrated because they’ve encouraged having hope, and said he could recover. But if that is not the case My baby deserves the truth. I’d like him to pass with comfort and dignity. I want to have the information to make the right decision. And to fully understand his condition

2020-11-15 07:16:20 : Is organized crime a threat to the revolution? : alleywaydog : https://www.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/jui0nf/is_organized_crime_a_threat_to_the_revolution/

I'm not going to be too specific, but I live in a country where organized crime bankrolls politicians, law enforcement, syndicates, journalists, and basically anyone with power. If you don’t comply, you or your family pay the price. 

Many poor people choose this life because it’s either that, extremely low-wage jobs or death. It's honestly gotten so out of hand that peole can't envision a world without it.

I strongly believe communism would eliminate the necessity for a lot of the people that get dragged into organized crime to participate in it, as they would have all their basic needs met. But, in the meantime, wouldn’t the crime lords put up a fight? (Organized crime is, after all, capitalism taken to the extreme) Would they just take their business somewhere else? And what about how they may try to scare people away from joining the revolution? (I also think it’s worth mentioning that, for many people, the idea of peddling some drugs and getting some money to put food on the table today may be more attractive than fighting for the prospect of a revolution down the line)

Are there any historical examples of organized crime being dealt with before and after establishing communism? How do you personally think this should be dealt with?

Because I’m a teenager and I work in fast food, old people think it’s okay to treat me like I don’t know what I’m doing and like I’m a piece of shit. One lady left a scathing review online because I refused to give her a free cup because we don’t allow refills. I want to quit so bad. It’s been about three months and I don’t want to work with food—too much to worry about. I want to work in a bookstore. I’m a very quiet person, and I want to work in a place where I can keep my hair down and be around books all day. However, my folks won’t let me quit. They told me if I quit then they won’t let me get another job so I won’t be able to pay for my car insurance so I won’t be able to drive anywhere. That’s literally what they said. So I’m stuck feeling very very miserable and like I’m going to yell at a customer whenever they treat me like shit. The only thing I really like about my job is my coworkers. They’re really really sweet to me and it’s been so long since I had friends. I’m just so stuck and I don’t know what to do. 

Does anyone have any advice for me, any at all? Because I really need it.

Yeah I know, those who fail to learn history are doomed to repeat it, but it's not like any of us are going to be world leaders! And the fact that we learn A FACT BASED SUBJECT for at least EIGHT YEARS is highly annoying for me. Want me to summarize those eight years in one sentence? "Be good, don't kill people even if they are bad bois". That's the sentence.

The real problem is that history is a fact based subject, meaning that the students don't use any logical thinking. All you do is learn useless informations. And even worse, you need this subject to graduate to further education for some dumb reason! What if I wanted to be a mathematician, programmer, scientist, lawyer or any other job type that involves logic? All that it's doing is getting us ready to become a factory worker or historian (which are not bad jobs at all, they are pretty important, I just don't want to be one).

So guess what, school? You need change. A lot of change. The world is moving very quickly while you are still here telling us ancient politics. Grow. Up.


TL; DR: History has no logic involved in it yet is for some reason needed for graduation making it a useless subject for me :/

2020-11-15 09:55:47 : Stop relying on Kickstarter so much : Maxwell_Bloodfencer : https://www.reddit.com/r/KingdomDeath/comments/jujlef/stop_relying_on_kickstarter_so_much/

In one of the recent updates Poots mentioned how he wanted to order another re-print of the core game, but didn't want to start another Kickstarter while the last one is still going. Which is fair enough, you shouldn't ask people for money when there is still a considerable amount of product you haven't shipped to your previous customers.

My question is: Why use Kickstarter at all? This is no longer a passion project of a man with a dream and no means to achieve it by himself. Poots has built a popular brand and a business around it, and something like that should be self-sufficient at this stage.

The scary alternative to KS would be taking a small business loan. Just enough to cover production and shipping to your warehouses. Again, Poots has a pretty successful business so it shouldn't be hard to secure a loan. Downsides are that there's going to be less profit from sales, since he'll have to cover interest for the loan and he might get a bad deal, since banks only hand out loans when they actually profit from them.

Another, much safer, alternative would be to simply put up the core game for pre-order. Set a certain period in which you accept pre-orders, produce as many copies as you need and maybe some extra. Any surplus you make will disappear from your store within seconds because people are very eager to get their hands on this game, if previous sales serve as any indication.

Finally, if Poots does do another KS campaign, I really want him to bring down the scope. The 1.5 KS offers a pretty amazing value, I think, with all the add-ons, pinups and bonus miniatures. You can stock your own personal miniature collection exclusively with the rewards from that KS and it would still be a very big and impressive collection. But, as we have seen, it also leads to issues with fulfillment. There is simply too much that needs to be made and shipped out to backers.   
Just, please tone it down for the next one. A lot. Maybe throw in one or two new expansions and a handfull of exclusive pinups, just to make sure people don't have to wait 10 years to finally get what you owed them.

I fully understand it’s bad and gross. But I heard about friends that have been harassed and a friend I talked to today was sent unsolicited nudes from some rando on Snapchat. But that never happens to me and I’m kinda jealous. No one ever catcalls me, gripes me, stalks me, or sends me unsolicited stuff unless it’s on Grindr, or harasses me. I get that sexual harassment is bad, but I feel like I get no attention. I just want some attention and validation from wherever. But no one ever sexually harasses me. Am I not attractive??

2020-11-15 09:57:06 : Do you have cravings for a new entry in that one obscure yet unique genre you've played before? : Cheelboi : https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/jujlux/do_you_have_cravings_for_a_new_entry_in_that_one/

First things first, I'd like to apologize for the overly specific title. As cliché as it may sound for Reddit, my English is not very good - not in the sense that I suck at grammar, but in getting my point across. Anyhow...

This might be a controversial opinion to some (and if it isn't, I apologize in advance), but, to me, the period between the 2000's and 2010's was surprisingly. Back then, what some people now like to call "AA" or "B-tier" gaming development was in full swing, and we had plenty of studios implementing interesting yet risky ideas using proper budgets and manpower provided by their publishers.  Of course, even in this sphere you still had plenty of trend chasers and stuff like polish studios putting out one generic FPS after another - matter of fact, I'd go so far as to say trend chasers overshadowed all of these interesting ideas and gave the beginning of the 21st century a bad name. Still, even the big fish weren't afraid of dipping into dangerous waters. Games like Okami from Capcom or From Dust by Ubisoft were really trying to push the envelope of creativity at the time.

Back in 2007, I was a huge fan of Jagged Alliance 2. It was a tactical, turn-based role-playing game in the vein of XCOM, but instead of fighting aliens as the sci-fi World Police, you were fighting a South American dictatorship. There were many major differences apart from that. For starters, the ballistics system and the tactical combat portion itself was very in-depth. Every bullet was simulated, the player needed to account for stances, cover and other factors; there was plenty of non-gun tactical equipment coming into play such as mortars, tear gas, C4, what have you; hell, there even was a proper camo system! Secondly, it married a proper CRPG system with the aforementioned in-depth tactical layer. Arulco, the country where the action takes place, really felt like a nation, with different factions such as rebels, mafia, citizenry and the local armies occupying various sectors for you to visit and retake. Your goal wasn't something to liberate the whole place, but rather, assassinate the head honcho in charge, Queen Deidriana. In the true CRPG fashion, you can approach this objective head-on or fight a proper guerilla war through a surprisingly deep strategic layer with sector defenses, militia training, and resource gathering in the form of mine income - thanks to that, every playthrough was different. Thirdly, there were the mercs themselves. They're nothing special today, but back then, when creators of military-based games didn't go out of their way to give their characters semi-detailed, quirky backstories, it was a welcome addition. Unlike X-com, each operative was not only entirely unique, but also had a unique voice and even special responses to certain in-game events (not gonna spoil here).

After finishing the game multiple times and playing some mods such as Urban Chaos, I wanted more. One day, while studying in my computer class, I watched a group of grown-up students play a really weird, simulator-like game. I looked like some kind of third-person shooter at first, until I saw a really weird interface with stuff such as adrenaline levels tracking and stats. Later, I learned that the name of the game was Brigade E5. It was a Russian spiritual successor to Jagged alliance, with two key differences - it was 3d, and it was real-time. Not just real-time, however - it had a "tactical pause" wherein you were able to stop the combat to issue orders. When I finally played it, however, I realized it had much, MUCH more - and less, at the same time. For starters, the ballistics system in this game is probably the most detailed in history, next to possibly Silent Storm and the ARMA/Flashpoint series. Secondly, unlike the creators of JA2, the people at Apeiron weren't just gun fans - they were gun fanatics. Just take one look at the game's IMFDB page to see what I mean. Thirdly, while stuff like mortars, destruction (there was some, but it was primitive) was absent, there was simulated shock (either from a wound or multiple hostiles appearing at the same time), armor coverage, penetration, ricochet, the aforementioned adrenaline system, and much more. This made combat feel extremely realistic, to the point where I would say this is THE most realistic tactical, infantry-based combat game ever made. The game was lacking JA2's charisma, though, and the setting was once again South America - this is because it was originally supposed to be JA3, but the idea was scrapped after a difference in opinion between the original developers at Sir-Tech and Apeiron. Nevertheless, it did offer something different - by expanding the simulation layer considerably.

Even back then, games in the vein of JA2 were a relatively untapped niche, and it was mostly the Russian and German developers that wanted to continue the original's legacy. Apart from E5, there was its sequel 7.62 High calibre, which was more of an expansion on the original's ideas; Silent storm, a WW2 TRPG which had an amazing destruction system; and then there were the "official" sequels - JA Back in Action, JA Flashback and JA Rage!. And they were, eeeehhh... the first game was basically 7.62 high calibre with a bit more charm and none of the complexity; Never played JA flashback but didn't hear anything good about it; JA:Rage!... a cheap clone of nu-Xcom with JA coat of paint, really. It was fun, but should've really been called something else, because thanks to this game, I'm unsure whether there's any more interest in making a JA sequel.

Now, yes, there are plenty of TRPG's available nowadays, in various shapes and sizes. However, I feel that none of them have even a quarter of depth that made JA and Apeiron's the niche hits that they were. Take hit-chance for example. In most of these games, ballistics are either super dumbed down, only aesthetical, or straight up non-existent. Most FPS shooters nowadays, such as Escape from Tarkov and ARMA, have superior ballistics that those games. It can be argued that coding it in would be too time consuming and putting such system in would break the game and make it needlessly complicated - but there could've been at least one TRPG that catered to the niche crowd of realistic gun fight lovers like that, come on. Or, something even worse, the movement system. For some reason, a huge chunk of tactical games nowadays likes to use nu-Xcom's "scoot'n shoot" system with one turn reserved for one movement and attack only. I'm not saying this is bad - hell, games that use it tend to have some interesting ideas - but it's so prevalent to the point where I don't see the classic AP system used. The only game in the past five years I've seen that is closest to JA2 tactical layer wise is Xenonauts, which is, funnily enough, an original X-Com spiritual successor. 

To summarize my problem, none of the contemporary TRPG's can be called simulators, or even have elements of such. Please feel free to correct me if I'm being unfair, but when I play a contemporary TRPG, I feel like I'm playing a digital board game rather than a proper video game. Granted, very well crafted and interesting board games with no human computations and ease of accessibility - but board games nonetheless.

I understand that AAA developers nowadays play stuff super safe, and that indie developers are focused on reviving the Nintendo-era nostalgia and roguelikes with tons of platformers, beat-em ups and metroid'vanias. Despite all this, I'm still holding out for a proper, deep TRPG with simulator elements, like JA2 and the Apeiron games were.

With my experience out of the way, it's time to hear your story. Do you, for example, miss the genre of U-boat simulator games? Original Rainbow Six-likes? Or maybe it's something strange but interesting like Lemming-likes? Discuss!

2020-11-15 09:57:17 : [Employment] is any of this legal? Toronto, ON : Xoxo-gossipgirl3 : https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvicecanada/comments/jujlxn/employment_is_any_of_this_legal_toronto_on/

I’m unsure where to post this to however I’m in need of some help. 
I started a new job and have been working between 35-40 hours per week. There was a point when I had been asked to come into work 3 weeks straight and it began to affect my health. I had to beg to have a day off after the second week and whenever I was ‘given the day off’ I’d still get asked to come into work for that day. 
I’ve noticed my pay has been less than $400 after deductions and mention it to my superior. She only says it’s after deductions and if I want to make more money then I need to bring in more money (I’ve brought in a few of my own clients before and have had clients since 3 weeks into me beginning to work there). 
I wasn’t feeling well and asked my boss if I could do a half day a couple days ago and was told to go home. I toughed it out at work the next day and worked the whole day (over 8 hours and only took one 15 minute break, no unpaid 30 minutes)
She called in yesterday and when I went in, shortly after I began feeling sick and vomited. I wasn’t sure if I’m supposed to give a heads up or not due to the pandemic and she told me to just go home. However she then followed up that text and said ‘we need to talk about your sick days, and  possibly scaling down your hours. I think maybe this job it too overwhelming for you. ‘ and then continues to text ‘Iam not saying your not sick but to be honest you call in sick more then anyone else, and I need someone at the front desk who is consistent.’ 
The only other time I actually called in (aside from this week) was in the beginning when I had got back onto my medication and wasn’t reacting well to it. Other than that I was begging for a day off after being asked to come in 2 weeks straight. I’m just wondering if this is legal?

2020-11-15 09:57:23 : Giving characters fitting deaths : uncreativeuser3 : https://www.reddit.com/r/CharacterDevelopment/comments/jujlyu/giving_characters_fitting_deaths/

 

In the story I am working on, there is a group of time travelers who take humans (and other living things) from earth and place them on an exoplanet, as something of a gigantic-scale experiment. The rule with humans is to only take humans who would die without children. Most are from prehistoric times, which are regulated loosely, however some  are from modern times, which are regulated so the person is taken moments before their death and their last moments/whatever happened to their body afterwards is replicated exactly through illusions. My problem is that I can’t decide how the main characters “die”. They are from modern times. I don’t want it to be overly angsty, they are young (14/15 years old) and I want their deaths to be fitting to them.

One is a boy who lives with his two working parents, and siblings. He feels responsible for his younger and older siblings alike- he is family orientated. He is a happy, loving, kind person.

Another lives with his grandmother, his grandfather died when he was 10. His mother and father are separated, but both somewhat in his life. He is a nerd, and enjoys talking about his interests. He is also impulsive, which has led to stupid decisions and arguments/fights with people he disagrees with.

The third character lives with his parents. He has anxiety and works hard on trying to fit in, despite it taking its toll on him. His friends are toxic but he keeps them for the sake of not being friendless. He plays soccer, which is freeing to him.

2020-11-15 09:58:36 : Advice needed on how to subtly seduce my host dad : blackvelvetnekozava : https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/jujmdf/advice_needed_on_how_to_subtly_seduce_my_host_dad/

Well so I (19F) am currently staying with a host family consisting of two lovely boys and their dad (55M). Me and the host dad spend a lot of time together as he's working from home and we're in lockdown (except the schools are open so the children are gone most of the time). From the beginning on we've had great chemistry but more on a friendship level.

Things got messy when we had a long talk about sex on a car ride. We were talking for nearly an hour and it was incredibly interesting to hear his stories and share our personal experience with each other. Obviously he's a lot more experienced than I am and during the convo I couldn't help myself but wonder how his experience might show in bed and how compatible we would be sexually. 

So after our conversation he was like "well, I have a boner now" and while my first reaction was "eww too much information" I was actually a little aroused too. 

What might also be good to know is that he's in a very messed up relationship situation where his gf basically moved to the end of the world to find herself and they haven't even texted in two weeks. 

Ever since our sex talk in the car we have been occasionally talking about sex. He also insisted on taking bikini pics of me while we were in the beach (obviously with my consent). So might that be a sign that he took those pics so he could get off to them? Even the mere thought of that makes me horny.

 Well so lately my sex drive has been through the roof because of him and I'd love to have sex with him. I know it might affect our relationship within this family thing but since our communication is really god we'd be able to handle it. 

This is where I need your help. How do I subtly seduce him or let him know that I'd be open for sex with him without messing up our relationship if he's not into me, doesn't find me attractive or whatever? Like I'd love to subtly seduce him into making the first move

Oh btw I'm sorry for any grammar mistakes since english is not my first language

Hey everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

ADC has always been my worst lane but at the same time the one I have the most fun playing. So I decided to dedicate time and energy into learning this role for season 11. I want to OTP Ezreal and will probably have 1-2 other picks for when he's banned/picked.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm ideally looking for a support to play draft normal games (for now), but feel free to  add me ingame if you're focused on improving and want someone to team up with.

&amp;#x200B;

If you're toxic or focus too much on chatting, don't bother answering, thanks.

Hello!
I realized from the pandemic that I need to try and make a few new friends, since I'm really lonely-

Here's some random facts about me:
- I'm 15
- I use keyboard emojis occasionally like :o, :D, :), :(, ;( and some actual emojis-
- I listen to k-pop, which is Korean music, which helps me a lot because I'm also currently learning Korean!
- I'm not great at video/voice calls
- I watch anime, my favourite anime currently is HxH
- I don't game, but I love watching gaming channels.
- Lately I'm into Among Us game streams,,,
- I cant really communicate well with people who are too calm or too energetic
- I really like sushi
- I want to learn how to play the guitar
- If you're into music then you're probably my favourite person ever
- I love when people tell me about things they're interested in because I love to learn about new things
- My favourite color is purple, and I love daisies

That was pretty long- Anyways,, please message me!
I'm okay with friends of either gender, but I'd feel a little uncomfortable if you're over 20

I probably won't see any dms on

2020-11-15 09:59:28 : 2020- year of the Mirena. My experience : haylz328 : https://www.reddit.com/r/Mirena/comments/jujmpg/2020_year_of_the_mirena_my_experience/

This is my account of the Mirena. 

On the 12th February I excitedly went to go and get my Mirena fitted. I’d had the copper coil before but it had made me continuously bleed. I had hear the Mirena coil could stop your periods all together or at least reduce heavy periods. I thought it was the thing for me. Being on the UK NHS system it was a difficult system to navigate through but I got there eventually. 

The procedure was quite painful. It felt like a few moderate contractions while they measured my uterus and placed the coil (Mirena) inside. I left and had no further symptoms it was great! The Mirena was right for me!! 

From the 5th of March I had a bout of sickness. Which we now believe was covid as I had an antibody which was positive. It wasn’t anything too serious just a cold. A week or so later the air felt disgusting. I needed to be outside I could feel every dust particle in the room as I took a breath. 

March 20th I went off work completely short of breath. In a respiratory pandemic nobody will consider you for anything else other than Covid. Chest X-ray after chest X-ray it came back clear. My oxygen levels were perfect my heart was working just fine. I even had an endoscopy and an ultra sound, they all came back clear. Nobody could figure out what was wrong with me, my blood oxygen was 100% but I was gasping for breath. 

I was placed in the long haul Covid category and spoke to many others online. My symptoms didn’t seem to match theirs. I was only short of breath. Every month I passed a few very small clots which is another symptom post Covid but no real blood. 

Months went by 8 to be precise with no joy of an answer. I was diagnosed with asthma but none of my inhalers would work. There was no hope. Due to my experiences I had my first panic attack in March and I have had around 20 since then. My blood pressure would sky rocket out of nowhere. I’d be sitting completely calm and my blood pressure would be 178/132. 

On Wednesday I went to A&amp;E (UK emergency room) short of breath, with palpitations and a band around my chest. All tests came back negative again. ECG was fine. My doctor asked me if I had any allergies, I replied codine. She asked me what happened if I took it, I replied exactly what’s happening to me now! She asked me if I’d taken any meds like that which I hadn’t but I had a lightbulb moment about the coil. 

On Thursday I went to get it removed. I began bleeding the day after and my breath is coming back. I wake up on a morning not gasping for air anymore. The Mirena ruined the last 8 months of my life, It left me disabled. I can look at the good side though, I quit smoking, began trying to exercise and eat better and I also leaned how to take care of myself mentally better. 

I also had raging anxiety while I had the coil now I feel like that has all gone! I stood in my mums kitchen and for the first time in months I felt relaxed and happy! This is only my experience and not everyone’s.

2020-11-15 10:23:51 : This game really isn't all that great. : coalserpent : https://www.reddit.com/r/ARK/comments/jujvb7/this_game_really_isnt_all_that_great/

I know that this title may seem a bit dramatic, but it comes from a place of love and disappointment.  I love this game, I want to love it even more. In fact, it even used to be my favorite game of all time. But now, I just can't bring myself to pop it on anymore. The news about new stuff being added and all the community announcements don't excite me anymore.

This game could be contender for best game ever but it falls short in just about every category worth naming. Where to begin? Even if you can get it to work perfectly with no technical issues (which by the way if you can you are a absolute god or just lying) it still has so many baffling design decisions and just overall mediocrity in so many vital areas. This will be done in a bullet point sort of list to help keep readability so please bear with me.

1. **Dinosaurs look cool but control awfully:** This is my personal biggest complaint with the game barring the technical side. They just don't feel all that good to handle. From the mighty t-rex to the more subdued velociraptor  they all handle extremely similarly to each other and feel more akin to driving a poorly programed tank with legs/fins/wins than actual living creatures. They are clunky, awkward, and just overall not very satisfying once the utter joy and bliss riding some of these creatures wears off like it did for me.
2. **AI of creatures is just plain bad:** I wanted to set up a caravan once to transport all of my supplies from one base to another in single player. I thought it would be this super cool and epic thing with my herd of triceratops  (from now on called 3 horned for convenience). So I set up my caravan and ready to go and it took me exactly 30 seconds to realize my mistake. The AI is simply not capable of following you the player around for more than 30 seconds without getting stuck on something and inevitably being left behind unless you constantly babysit them making sure to regularly go back get them unstuck and try again only for it to happen 5 seconds later. The AI is so basic and rudimentary that it can't handle doing even the most basic of things like chase after you properly. Such as pissing off the biggest threats in the game like a giga trivially easy if you just stand on a cliff or other piece of geometry which it cant immediately charge straight at you to reach. It is simply incapable of the most basic problem solving skills which can be rather off putting for some players and make the already robotic feeling creatures even more so.
3. **Fighting both on and off Dinosaur:** When you are on a dinosaur you get your main attack and usually a secondary attack of some sort. That is it. When 2 dinosaurs fight (or rather 2 players on dinosaurs fight) it looks rather comical to watch due to how the combat is set up in this game. For example, take a 3 horned vs a t-rex. What should be a classic bout between a apex predator and a very dangerous defensive herbivore devolves into complete degeneracy almost instantly. If you have played the game before you will know what I am talking about but for everyone else I got you covered. When they fight it will either be the 3 horned repeatedly knocking back the t-rex over and over again until it dies due to its basic attack knockback or the t-rex will knock the 3 horned back over and over again with its main attack until it dies. This is just one of many examples of how dinosaur combat is extremely basic and resembles this basic set up most of the time or the one to get the jump on the other one first wins. When off a dinosaur and doing on foot combat it is only marginally better. Sure the options are more varied but whether using a pike/sword/bow/gun it all feels oddly stiff and unnatural. Its really hard to explain just how off the guns feel unless you played any shooter in recent history. The melee weapons are even worse off. Not only are the animations stiff and hitboxes all over the place but the sound effect and physical effect for hitting doesn't always work so knowing when you hit something can be a bit of a crapshoot when in any other game it would be obvious and impossible to miss.
4. **building and world interaction:** I wanted to love the building in this game. I truly did, it was about half the reason why I got it in the first place. It just doesn't work very good though, not without a lot of frustration and effort to make it cooperate with you even though sometimes it really feels like it doesn't want to. It doesn't help its case that the world is completely immutable and unchangeable itself. What I mean is that the terrain itself cannot be altered in anyway. A hill will always be a hill, uneven bumpy terrain will stay that will, the natural rises and falls of terrain also cannot be changed. Why is this a big deal for building? simple, much of the terrain in Ark is not builder friendly. A combination of obnoxious building restrictions and little flat land makes building what you want in a easy manner virtually impossible of any decent size. It can be worked around sure, just like most things in this game. But this takes precious time, effort, and resources to finagle a solution that works for you which is just another element frustrating basic enjoyment  of the game.

so what's the point I assume is what you are asking. Well, that is simple. I absolutely adore this game. It genuinely makes me so happy hearing it talked about and seeing new videos pop up about and new content being added and everything else surrounding it. This is quite possibly my favorite game of all time even to this day. Its everything I ever wanted out of a game growing up. But, with the way this game tends to run, the various lackluster elements of the game, the questionable design decisions, and the general attitude this company has towards these well known issues, it has sucked what fun I could force myself to have playing this game. I just can't do it anymore. I want this to be something I play and only play almost like a personal MMO of sorts if that makes any sense. But in its current state and the fact that these fundamental problems I have with the game will in all likely hood never be addressed.

So this is my post on the game. The problems with it and what I wished would/could be changed to make this my go to game yet again.

I hope I didn't come off to negative or that I find this game unplayable or anything like that. I tried my hardest to sound as fair and genuine in my complaints as I could in a understandable manner. I also hoped that this post could foster some discussion perhaps on the stat of affairs of the game without devolving into either a hateful sest-pool or a place for fanboys (previously and still somewhat currently myself) of the game to tell everyone why the game is perfect and should never be altered at all unless its more content and nothing else ever.

If anyone bothers to read all this, thank you for your time and happy dino hunting.

2020-11-15 10:24:19 : Reminders not showing up on my Mi Band 4 : Laurul95 : https://www.reddit.com/r/taskito/comments/jujvgy/reminders_not_showing_up_on_my_mi_band_4/

Hey,
I have recently discovered Taskito and I love it. I was looking for an alternative to the default Samsung reminders app that could also integrate my calendar without clutter and not be owned by Google. So I naturally loved it.
The only big issue that I have so far is that I have a Xiaomi Mi band 4 (a smart bracelet) and the Mi Fit app allows me to get notifications on the bracelet from the apps that I choose. It works perfectly for the Samsung Reminders app, but the notifications do not show up from Taskito. Any idea why? Is this not a feature yet or is it bugged/not working for me?
Note that I think it's the Mi Fit app that sends the notifications to the bracelet, not the apps themselves.

So I've tried this campaign multiple times, but Gor rok the bastard is just too fucking strong. On turn 7 he already has 15 saurus warriors with bronze chevrons and 5 skinks with throwing weapons. Even with 2 full stacks made up of skaven slaves and skrolks starting units, I have no chance to beat him. I've tried to hide from him and recruit catapults ASAP, but by the time I have recruited them, he's already at my capital with a full stack, sometimes with another army with 3 units of saurus

2020-11-15 10:25:18 : I work as a private contractor for a security firm. There's a reason we always check the employees shift schedule. : CharlesCurtisFanboy : https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/jujvse/i_work_as_a_private_contractor_for_a_security/

 

“Hello Team A-7, this is radio operator Tom Clemens reporting. New job. Some fancy rich neighbourhood a distance away from here. Type B normal security guarding duty, use of lethal force to be a last resort. These folks are going to be paying both of you for 4 hours.” The radio was on, and our shoulder lights were blinking once more. I looked at Mike, and high-fived him. Tonight was yet again going to be an easy cash grab.

&amp;#x200B;

A bit about myself first. I work as a threat management officer (fancy term for security guard/private police) for a small private security company stationed in my hometown. We usually operate in the more crime-ridden parts of the city, where we protect stores and homes, charging our customers by the minute and by how dangerous the job is. Tonight, a cool and breezy Thursday, it was a Type B run, meaning an ordinary security patrol with near minimal risk. Mike and I would be bringing along our flashlights, stun guns, and batons.

&amp;#x200B;

It was around 9 pm and pitch black when our jeep arrived at the outskirts of the forest, where our supposed patrol location was supposed to be. I was confused. 

&amp;#x200B;

“Command, Tom, are you sure this is the right place? You said some rich fancy neighbourhood. All I can see here are trees, and I don’t think trees pay well.” I said into the radio. Mike had stepped outside of the jeep to look around.

&amp;#x200B;

“Uh, yea, apparently the neighbourhood is inside the forest. Supposed to be a rich people thing. There’s around 20 houses in there, all within this cul-de-sac.” The radio answered. 

&amp;#x200B;

“I ain’t ever heard of, nor seen any rich people go out of town to live in this forest, and in all my years living here I’ve never heard of an enclave of wealthy residents within an isolated forest. Something’s a bit off about this,” I said to Mike, as he walked back towards the jeep. Mike nodded. “Still, it’s good money Jack. And if they don’t pay up front we leave. Here, I found the path into the trees.” Mike stepped into the jeep, and soon we were accelerating past the thick trees and shapeless bushes. The path was completely dark, and our only source of light was from the jeep itself. The atmosphere outside felt a bit too noiseless and quiet, the silence being broken by the jeep’s wheels crushing the occasional fallen tree branch.

&amp;#x200B;

The neighbourhood itself was a different story. As we pulled up to it, we realized that there were several well lit houses, and dozens of street lamps, scattered around the cul-de-sac. Except for a man standing at the entrance gate between the forest road and the neighbourhood, there was noone.

&amp;#x200B;

“$960. Here you go,” The guard, or whatever he was, said, as he opened the gates and handed Mike a briefcase through the open windows of the jeep. “The folks here told me to give this to you when you came. I’ll be leaving now.” And with that, the only living soul we actually saw began walking off in the direction which we had come.

&amp;#x200B;

Mike counted the money. “$2 for every minute per person, multiplied by 2 people, multiplied by 60 minutes multiplied by 4. And here we have 96 $10 notes. Yep, that’s the correct amount.” I nodded, and slowly drove past the opened metal gate, which shut behind us automatically.

&amp;#x200B;

The neighbourhood was silent. Something really felt off. Maybe it was the fact that all the houses were brightly lit, yet there was noone we could actually see in them, or outside of them. Maybe it was the forest, the dark treeline where one branch seemed to merge with another, one tree indistinguishable from another, the mess of blurred barely visible shapes surrounding the cul-de-sac, which was putting us off. Maybe it was because all the houses looked exactly identical to each other from the outside, all 2 story bungalows with garages as big as my own house. But whatever it was, Mike and I didn’t feel comfortable. We parked our jeep near the entrance, and stayed inside it, locking our doors.

&amp;#x200B;

For a while, not much happened. The clock slowly seemed to tick by. Half an hour passed, then an hour. It was soon 10.30pm, and Mike and I were close to falling asleep, wrapped in our warm company issued blankets (meant to be used for comforting trauma victims, but nobody said we couldn’t use it), when all of a sudden, the lights all throughout the cul-de-sac went out.

&amp;#x200B;

Every. Single. One. 

The 20 houses went dark, and their windows illuminated previously by bright indoor lamps switched off simultaneously. The streetlamps flickered and died in synchrony. And outside, we saw the leaves on the trees shaking. Mike stared outside in disbelief, and whispered, his voice soft and shaking, “J-Jack? Either these homes all have their light sources synced up, or there’s something here trying to mess with us. I don’t feel safe. Let’s head back out, and tell the company that ---”

&amp;#x200B;

“Relax, Mike. It’s a rich people thing I’m sure. If these fellas can afford two story bungalows to be built in this sort of secluded area, then they can afford whatever contraptions they want. Let’s just sit back and rest. I want every single cent from my share of $480.” I said, closing my eyes. I was starting to get very drowsy in the back of the jeep. And as soon as I finished speaking, the sounds began.

&amp;#x200B;

High pitched screams, like that of a female's, suddenly filled our ears, and I sat up in fright, instinctively reaching for my stun gun. Mike, sat upright on the driver’s seat, began to look around from behind the windshield with eyes wide open and bulging in terror. The screams continued, becoming shriller and shriller, until our ears almost went deaf. I put my gloved hands around my head, and went dug my head in between my thighs, until the screaming finally stopped.

 

“It’s a Type 2 contract so it means we are supposed to check on these people too. I guess we have no choice,” Mike said, as he turned around. His face was pure white, and I could see the sweat on his forehead. I nodded. “Only a quick check, and then we will return to our cars.” I added.

&amp;#x200B;

As we slowly unlocked the jeep doors, we felt an extremely cool breeze beginning to rustle the treeline around us. The night was dark and the moon was obscured by clouds. I led the way, using my own torchlight, until we came to the bungalow where we thought the noise had emerged from. Apprehensively, with Mike standing on the right and myself standing on the left side of the doorway, I rapped my knuckles upon the door.

&amp;#x200B;

And nothing happened.

&amp;#x200B;

We waited for a while, before deciding it was best we head back to the jeep. The both of us had nothing to defend ourselves with, so we began running back to the jeep. When we were a few feet away from our vehicle however, we heard the door from the very same house creak open.

&amp;#x200B;

Mike was the first to turn around, and from a few feet behind me I could hear his absolutely primal and guttural yells of terror. At that point I could feel my hands and feet turning ice cold, and when I turned around, I saw Mike standing still, his back facing me. I peered further beyond, and...my god.

&amp;#x200B;

The door was open, revealing behind it and within the house a completely pitch black void. Right in front of it, slowly crawling down the steps onto the front lawn and driveway, was an emaciated and bony humanoid figure. It was crawling on all fours, it’s pale, whitish-grey legs and arms bent almost 90 degrees at the knees and elbows respectively. The thing’s face was facing downwards, and completely obscured by the long, thick strands of black hair hanging down low enough to touch the floor. 

&amp;#x200B;

I froze in fear for a second, and was completely mesmerized by the spider-like movements of the creature. It’s neck was long, longer than a human’s, and it stretched out into the air by a few inches, before moving and twisting about in all directions, like a cobra moving its head about in the air. When the creature’s head was finally pointing in our direction, a noise, a mix between the screeching of the tyres of a car, the yelling of a human, and the screaming of a kettle, began to originate from within it.

&amp;#x200B;

Mike was still frozen in fear, but I was not. Calling out to him, I jumped into the jeep in the driver’s seat, and turned round expecting to see my colleague right behind me. Yet the fool was still outside, standing as stiff as a rock. From the corner of my eye I could see the creature skittering towards us, its thin limbs moving with the speed and agility a human could not match. Within the blink of an eye it was closing onto Mike.

&amp;#x200B;

As the creature was barely a few dozen feet away from Mike, I stepped out, stun gun in hand. Mike was still standing, facing towards the direction of the creature with his back turned on me, as I pointed my weapon at the creature. The thing, as soon as it was barely a few feet away from me, leapt, and I pulled on the trigger of my weapon. The 2 needles coursed through the air and directly hit the creature as its face was exposed to me; beneath the strands of long wiry hair obscuring most of its facial features I could see 2 partially covered eye sockets, both of which were empty and composed of dry, peeling skin. The creature fell upon the ground convulsing and twitching, and I pulled at Mike’s shoulder to force him to turn his face at me and head back to the jeep. What I saw next shall never leave me.

&amp;#x200B;

It was Mike still, but his face...it was gone. The facial features, the nose, the eyes, the lips, his mouth, they were gone. His face was creased with layers upon layers of his own skin, and the chin was now fused to the rest of the neck by what appeared to be even more thick flabby skin. The skin itself was moving, as if something from underneath it was crawling and wriggling about it, and flaps of it rose and fell along with the movement. Mike’s hands reached out to me, and grabbed the sides of my 2 arms. I could hear muffled noises coming from within what was once his face.

&amp;#x200B;

Dragging him into the jeep, I restrained him to the seats, and began driving away, knocking past the gate entrance. From my rear view mirror I could see the creature slowly get up, and look around; and I noticed the front doors on all the houses were now open.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

“So what prompted you to actually go into that forest?” The man asked, placing his hands on the table.

&amp;#x200B;

I looked down at my feet. “We-we thought it was just another routine call. We should have checked procedure.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Damn right you should have. Your friend, he’s dead. Doctors say they’ve never seen anything like it before. Died an agonizing death too. There’s a reason we have procedure.” I dared not look up, and nodded.

&amp;#x200B;

“We’ll let you keep your job. If your account holds true that was brave of you. You’ve got the guts at least. Go and report to your radio operator outside.” I stood up, and left. Tom, the radio operator, was waiting for me outside the debriefing room.

&amp;#x200B;

He stared at me, a frown on his face. “Jack. You of all people should know that I don’t take the Thursday night shift.”

2020-11-15 10:25:16 : USM Eudora Crew Confusion : ShigaHockey : https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadSpace/comments/jujvs0/usm_eudora_crew_confusion/

So I think we're to assume that the USM Eudora in Dead Space 3 was an EDF (Earth Defence Force) Ship like the USM Valor was. My problem with this is the fact that no one on the Eudora is wearing EDF marine armor like we saw on the Valor. Granted, most of the Eudora's crew was dead outside of the ones operating the bridge, but as seen on the USM Valor, even the pilot that communicates with the Ishimura is seen wearing the same EDF marine armor, therefore signifying that even the pilots of any EDF vessel are going to be wearing that specific armor. The only one with any sort of heavy armor on in the entire ship is Carver, and he isn't even a native on the ship (was picked up by the Eudora on Uxor). So why is no one wearing the popular EDF marine suit on the Eudora? The same suit that is practically the face of the entire EDF represented by the army recruitment ADs as seen in Dead Space 1? Is it because the Eudora wasn't actually an EDF vessel but some sort of Earthgov research ship?

To make matters worse, Dead Space 3 seems to imply that the room full of dead Earthgov security guards are most likely part of Norton's platoon that he brought with him from the Eudora. Why would an EDF ship not contain any EDF marines? And why would a military vessel contain soldiers wearing an armor also used by security guards? You'd think they would have something more heavy grade for soldiers such as the EDF marine armor seen in Dead Space 1 and Dead Space: Aftermath. This is all assuming that I'm correct about those dead security guards being part of Norton's crew, though. That being said, if I'm wrong about this fact, then what happened to the entire crew of the Eudora? It seems strongly implied that they were killed on the Lunar colony.

Personally, this feels like a retcon of the USM Valor and USM Abraxis by Visceral. I think they intended to make the Sprawl security guards become the new EDF marines as well. This doesn't make any sense from a narrative standpoint, so I really hope I'm wrong on that one.

2020-11-15 10:25:15 : Should I upsize to NCase M1/CM NR200? : jamieyz : https://www.reddit.com/r/sffpc/comments/jujvrs/should_i_upsize_to_ncase_m1cm_nr200/

Hi r/sffpc!

My desktop PC is currently Dan A4 that houses Ryzen 2060 and RTX 2600 Super. I primarily use it for video editing in Davinci Resolve and recently I started noticing that my GPU isn't really up to snuff anymore – Resolve often complains about "insufficient GPU memory", especially on complicated timelines. 

In light of that, as well as the recent CPU and GPU launches, I've been thinking about upgrading my system to something more beefy – for example, 5950x and 3080 Ti (when it comes out). However, I'm having concerns about Dan A4 being too small to handle parts that hot. Sure, I could get 645LT and a Losercard mod kit, but that would also limit the GPU compatibility. And even though it might be able to handle a 5950x and a 3080 Ti, it definitely won't stay quiet while doing that. 

So I've been thinking about switching to a bigger case – NR200 or M1. They both support big AIOs and 120mm fans, which would definitely make the system cooler and quieter. The size isn't a huge issue for me, since my A4 pretty much lives on my desk, but I would still prefer something as small as possible.

What are your thoughts? Should I switch to something bigger?

Are there any A4 owners that have had the experience of running "hot" parts in it?

2020-11-15 10:25:15 : My George Floyd Toy Came to Life : MbIfYouStannedLoona : https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/jujvrn/my_george_floyd_toy_came_to_life/

many of you reading this have probably heard of george floyd's death for those of you who live in a cave and  have never heard of it google it on your  own  i will be skipping the details on that  incident to get to the point faster.

shortly after the death of george floyd  there was a toy maker from russia who  started a page on instagram and tik-tok,  the pages were used for advertising his  latest product the george floyd toy  the george floyd toy comes in two main  types one of them being a george floyd  plush.  it was essentially a cartoonish george  floyd face printed on the head  wearing a black sweater and jeans. one of  the striking features being its stupidly large nose  the other type is a pillow with an image  of the george floyd plush printed on it.  

the comments on the instagram post  consisted of a ton of snowflakes getting  offended by the toys  the other comments were pretty hilarious  though some of them included jokes such  as using the toy as a knee rest  now i am a person who hates niggers, so that's when i had an idea to buy a  george floyd plush myself  and place it next to george floyd's  gravestone for a night.  i grabbed the mastercard and added it to  my paypal account,  after that i sent the toy maker the  paypal money and then emailed him my  address  it took eight days for a response so i  thought it was all a scam.  but after those days i got a response  from him - your order has  been accounted for and your george floyd  toy is now being sent to your address, delivery time will take 20 days. i didn't mind that because i knew it was going to  be well worth the wait.

fast forward 20 days i received the  package  the george floyd toy was inside a large  white bag with russian writing on it  i opened the bag to allow the george  floyd toy to breathe,  it was one of the sexiest objects i've  ever seen in my life,  i immediately brought it to the washroom  and busted a nut on it.  it felt so damn good now is the time to  put it next to george floyd's grave,  i happen to live very close to where he  lived so getting there wasn't a  challenge.  i only live an hour and a half from  where his grave is, i went into my car  and drove over to the town's graveyard,  once i arrived i searched every  gravestone in the yard,  it took very long and i was starting to  lose hope but finally  after 30 minutes of reading the names of  every dead person  i found one with the text rest in peace  george floyd  i celebrated and then placed the george  floyd toy sitting on top of the stone. it was getting late so i went home.

the  next day was time to get my george floyd  toy back,  so i went back to the graveyard, but when  i arrived  i got a mini heart attack i didn't see  my george floyd toy anywhere,  i panicked due to losing such a valuable  object. i cried a ton mainly because it  was a very good sex toy,  i accepted the loss and drove back home.  when i opened my front door  what i saw scared the shit out of me.

i  saw a george floyd toy with a knife on  his right hand, give me some fentanyl or i will kill you it said. i screamed and ran away, but holy  shit it was fast for its size, i thought this was going to be the end  of my life, i didn't know how a toy came  to life,  so george floyd's ghost had to have  haunted it, so i decided to go to the  nearest church.  the toy was still running at me but  thankfully i am slightly faster than it  was

i opened the door at the church and  slammed it behind me, the priest looked  at me judgmentally,  i told him i was being chased by a  haunted doll. there was loud banging on  the church door and i knew it was the  george floyd toy doing it,  so i opened it to have the priest  believe me.

george floyd toy rushed in  and pointed the knife at my neck  give me fentanyl please, it pleaded.   
the  priest, then grabbed it by the neck but  the george floyd toy was too strong, so  it slit the priest's throat. i thought i was going to die with no  more protection so i decided to battle  the george floyd toy smart,  knowing its main weakness, which is  breathing, so i kick the knife off its  hand and knead on its neck, as if it was  a knee rest.  i can't breathe it said.  i then started  jousting my penis on its face,  suffocating it, finally it died. i  celebrated in victory that i was  responsible for george floyd's second  death.

i then took the george floyd toy and  performed a cleansing ritual to make  sure george floyd's ghost is no longer  haunting it  after that i cut off its head and then  attached it to a fleshlight base to  create my very own george floyd  fleshlight, a good way to rid of those traumatizing  moments, while making good use of the  situation.

to those of you reading this do not  place dolls near their corresponding  dead corpses  and also fuck niggers

2020-11-15 10:25:26 : Any Fibromyalgia patients in there? Another year without diagnostics and my doctor just asked me to "wait to see where it goes". : barata_de_gravata : https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoid/comments/jujvuf/any_fibromyalgia_patients_in_there_another_year/

Summing up, i have pain on my shoulders, elbows, fingers, thigh connection with pelvis, knees and soles. Already went into orthopedists, rheumatologists, physiotherapists and nothing conclusive.

My best try still is the rheumatologist, but i am already hopeless. My exams are not conclusive, he discarded RA, now suspecting about fibromyalgia. This are my exams:

Rheumatoid factor: Positive one time, negative several times. When positive, very close to the acceptable value.

Anti-CCP test: Negative.

Ultrasound of shoulders and knees: Only the inflamed bursa, no wear of the joints.

With all that my doctor just said me to wait. I am not sure if he just doesn't have the minimum ideia of what do i have or if he is afraid of give me a strong medication for his only guess remaining (Fibromyalgia).

I am so confused about my pain symptoms. It sounds like if i walk for a while it really increases my chances of pain on the lower joints, at same time that even in days on the bed this parts also hurts. My shoulders crack too much, there are some days on which i can't even raise my hand. Thanks god i am working from home and without any pressure, but it still sucks try to hide it from everyone to not hear "you're to young for thst" shit and etc.

Not sure what to expect with this post. I am just really sad about how my like is going with this condition and not even know what is is.

My medicines are Cetoprofen for the worst days (recently almosf diary), dipyrone and ice packs.

2020-11-15 10:26:00 : Help on how to protest - Not HK : Due-Telephone210 : https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKongProtest/comments/jujvzw/help_on_how_to_protest_not_hk/

TL;DR: Tips on how to protest effectively, how to stop or slow police when they come.

I’m sorry if this post doesn’t belong on this sub, but if at least one person how knows about this could DM then it’ll be worthy.

For months I watched you protest and every month I was inspired by your bravery and cleverness to fight. 

Now my country faces adversity and people are on the streets, for the first time in my life I see a massive protest here that didn’t die in one or two days.

Yesterday two persons died... and as far as I’m aware so did a baby that was caught by the gas of the police force.

People want to fight for what is right but we need better ways to do so. I saw many of the things you did when you protested like: your shield walls, some improvised armors, how to stop the gas... and somethings like what you did defending PolyU: I remember seeing long pieces of wood over bricks... I even remember you built a trebuchet (or catapult).

Please, any information on how to be more effective protesting, how to at least slow the police when they come, faster ways to defuse the gas, anything. 

I appreciate any information you could give me, thank you.

2020-11-15 10:28:10 : It doesnt have to be this way : Dabznation : https://www.reddit.com/r/Midwives/comments/jujwpz/it_doesnt_have_to_be_this_way/

The past four days has shown me something. The absolute stressful situation that a woman is put in during her pregnancy by some staff members is wrong. Its like they don't want to be there. You have to be 100% passionate about being a midwife and you need to make decisions quickly and listen to your patients and the ones supporting them. 

It was a gamble every 8 hours, Would we get a fantasic midwife that knows what she is doing or you get an absolute bitch with no clue that has been in the healthcare sector for over 5 years.

If you cant even work out a catheter is draining too slow because of a blocked brether valve causing it to leak from the bladder you maybe should rethink your profession.  I worked it out in 5 minutes and its not my job. Hours of pain for my partner because she didnt listen to her patient and took 4 hours to make a decision. Don't get me wrong the was a lovley lady but way too indecisive.

A doctor made a comment at the start of our visit

"Midwives are indecisive and Doctors make split second decisions" I didnt know how close that would hit to home untill last night 

So I have decided to go to university to become a midwife or s similar role so women and their partners dont have to go through similar situations or in the worst case extreme neglect.

A woman is scared to voice her thoughts to a "professional" because for the next couple of hours they could make your life hell when it does not have to be that way.

Only 1% of men a midwives

For actual midwives i understand you cant possibly know everything and be absolutly perfect so please don't take this post to heart. If your a great midwife and a lovely person I thank you and I hope your prowd of what you do

2020-11-15 10:29:31 : (Updated) The Physiology of Aliens: Keevia : HiddenLayer5 : https://www.reddit.com/r/scifiwriting/comments/jujx5p/updated_the_physiology_of_aliens_keevia/

# The Physiology of Aliens: Keevia

*Adapted and translated from chapter 8.2.5 of the Exobiology Encyclopedia published by the Maloran Science Institute. Originally written by Doctor Taza Katatai, an exobiologist, medical officer for the Maloran Space Fleet, and a Keevia himself.*

Keevia (alternative spelling: Kievia) are a small quadrupedal species originating from the planet Malorus (formerly Keierus^1). They have a mean adult standing height from their paws to ear tips of 37 centimetres, length excluding the tail of 55 centimetres, and weight of 4 to 6 kilograms. Keevia are adapted for desert life, as their home planet is composed mostly of such an environment. The Keevia species addressed in this chapter is officially called the Mountain Keevia, so named because they most likely evolved in the equatorial mountains of Malorus. This is the only Keevia species that are not extinct and also the only one to have ever attained any sort of higher intelligence^2. In this book, "Keevia" refers to Mountain Keevia unless otherwise specified.

This species is unique as the first and currently only known quadruped to have independently become not only space faring but an interplanetary species, without influence from other alien life forms. Keevia have an average General Lifeform Intelligence Index of 9.3, in theory making them one of the most cognitively intelligent known species. However, as we explored in chapter 3.1.1, this metric is far from the definitive measure of intelligence that it was once thought to be.

^1 *The former name of the Keevia's home planet is Keierus. It was renamed Malorus because it was chosen as the capital planet of the Maloran Republic (-rus, pronounced "rez" is the suffix for planet in Keevian). For this reason, "Maloran" refers to something as being "from" or "of" the Maloran Republic, while "Keierian" refers to something as being "from" or "of" the planet of Malorus.*

^2 *The other Keevia species are the Forest Keevia, which are larger and has leopard-like circular markings, and the Giant Keevia, which can grow to over a meter tall, certainly giant from the perspective of the Mountain , the smallest species in the genus.*

## External Anatomy

Keevia have a dense coat of golden brown fur, with lighter beige regions on their abdomen, tail, and the inside of their ears. This colouration is most likely for camouflage as their main colour is almost identical to that of Keierian sand. Other color variations exist, but the gold and beige colors are the most common.

As with most small intelligent life forms, the head of a Keevia is large in relation to their body, consistent with the minimum brain size theory as discussed in chapter 3.2.19. The mean diameter of a Keevia's head is 15 centimetres, and on their head are a pair of large equilateral triangular ears, a short and pointy muzzle ending in a black nose, cyan eyes, and the Keevia's most famous facial feature, four beige (the same colour as their countershading), pointed projections on their cheeks, two on each side. These are antennae that allow them to sense and transmit electromagnetic radiation, allowing them to be telepathic (see below).

Their bodies are thin and are slightly narrower than their head. They have thin legs that end in paws adapted for agility both in dry sand and for climbing on a wide variety of surfaces, including trees and rocks. Their paws also sport sets of extremely durable enamel coated retractable claws. They also have a short, wide tail, sometimes called a "puff", with the Keevia's signature golden brown fur from the base to the two thirds point, followed by a beige tip. This tail is mainly used for balance but also plays an important role in Keevian body language, and can be used to cover the face to keep warm.

## General Physiology

### Biochemistry

Keevia, like the majority of known life forms, are carbon-water based and are built on a biological framework based around genetic material and proteins. Consistent with our findings in chapter 2.5.10, Keevia and other keierian lifeforms are consistent with the convergent evolution theory of exobiochemistry, granting them a high degree of compatibility with most other known extraterrestrial biochemistries, the most practical aspects of this is that Keevia are capable of safely eating and digesting most types of alien foods.

### Blood and Lymphatics

Keevia blood is a bright cyan due to the presence of copper as part of their oxygen carrier cells. However, their muscles are red as they contain iron. This is the same as most other animals on the planet of Malorus. A Keevia can safely metabolize large amounts of both iron and copper^3, unlike most species. This is theorized to be the result of Malorus's relative abundance of both iron and copper.

In the Keevia's lymphatic system, along with immune cells, there are a large amount of "general stem cells", which are capable of differentiating into all types of tissue^4, which allows a Keevia to efficiently repair damaged organs. This self repair mechanism is part of the reason Keevia can live to over two hundred Keierian years^5.

^3 *The clade of Keierian animals that use both iron and copper, including Keevia, split from the copper-only clades some 150 millions Keierian years ago.*

^4 *General stem cells are different from Keevian fetal stem cells as they are not capable of forming any sort of embryonic structure that could grow into new individual. If they were fetal cells, it would mean that any Keevia would have a natural cloning mechanism that could be activated by extracting their general stem cells.*

^5 *A Keierian year is one Earth year plus 67.29 Earth days.*

### Water Conservation

Malorus, being a desert planet, is expectedly extremely dry, and being a carbon-water based life form, Keevia have evolved to make the most out of the small amounts of water they can find. Metabolic processes have adapted to waste as little water as possible, and to recycle as much of the existing water in the body as possible. A Keevia's skin is impermeable to water, preventing loss by evaporation. They also produce very little urine compared to animals that are not adapted for such dry conditions.

Specialized cells form small water storage nodes throughout a Keevia's body, allowing them to drink large amounts of water whenever it is available, and store it for long periods of time when water may be difficult or impossible to acquire. An adult Keevia can survive up to 15 Keierian days without water.

### Thermoregulation

Keevia are capable of surviving in temperatures between 60 and -30 degrees celsius, which is an extreme temperature range but not unheard of in the Keierian deserts. Keevia are also known to have a great amount of physical strength and stamina, especially for their small size, which is a recipe for overheating during day time without special measures. To adapt to these conditions, they have evolved an impressive thermoregulation system.

Keevia don't sweat, nor do they pant to cool off. That would be too wasteful of precious water. Instead, their fur have the ability to modulate their thermal conductivity. When temperatures get too hot or cold, the fur turns into an insulator and shields their bodies from the thermal extremes (which is especially important if they are in direct sunlight), until temperatures become more mild, at which point the fur becomes thermally conductive to allow for the exchange of thermal energy.

If a Keevia's fur gets wet, the thermoconductivity of the affected hairs can get "stuck" at the most thermally conductive state until all of the water evaporates. Prolonged and untreated submersion of a Keevia's fur in water can damage the chemical pathway responsible for thermal regulation in each hair. For this reason, Keevia have a psychological stress response to contact with water. Both the stress response and the physiological effects it's meant to help avoid are rarely problems in their native environment, but can be points of concern for the modern Keevia living in a high-tech world, possibly on a planet where water is more abundant^4.

As impressive as the chemistry is, the ability of a Keevia's fur to change thermal conductivity have been greatly exaggerated by many. A common myth is that their fur can change between the equivalent thermal conductivity of copper and polystyrene at will, but this isn't true. In reality, the thermal conductivity change is fairly small, and is used in conjunction with the next adaptation.

Keevia take advantage of the principles of chemical equilibrium to convert between thermal and chemical energy in order to balance their internal temperature. When the internal temperature gets too hot, thermalregulatory chemicals throughout their body use the excess energy to undergo a reaction into a higher-energy state, cooling the body and storing the energy. The reverse occurs when the body cools down too much. This process is regulated by hormones and other thermoregulatory chemicals. This allows a Keevia to store energy when it's too hot and release energy when it's too cold, and also be able to exchange that energy with their surroundings through their fur. During the hottest days, a Keevia's internal temperature can be significantly cooler than the ambient temperature.

^6 *Pharmaceuticals designed to make Keevia both physiologically and mentally more tolerant of water are easily accessible in the Maloran Republic.*

### Diet and Digestion

Physiologically, Keevia are generalist omnivores who eat a wide range of animal and plant matter. The scarcity of food in their original habitat forced the Keevia to be capable of living on any type of food they could find and extracting as much nutrients from it as possible. Their bodies can can produce most nutrients they need either by directly synthesizing it or converting it from more generic biomolecules, in case they are unable to find food that contain them. As a result, Keevia require less variety in their diet than most omnivores, capable of being healthy while on a strict meat diet, a strict vegan diet, and most subsets in between. However, they do need relatively high amounts of both iron and copper while most other intelligent lifeforms require, sometimes significantly, more of one than the other.

Keevia have strong teeth that can be used for cracking open nuts and bones alike as well as tearing both plant and animal matter. The outer layers of their teeth regenerate in response to wear. Their dentition resembles that of most carnivores, meaning that though they are effective at tearing, they are less so at grinding tough vegetation. As a result, Keevia tend to eat by tearing up food into pieces just small enough for them to swallow them whole^5.

A Keevia's gastrointestinal tract consists of the mouth, esophagus, stomach, upper small intestines, lower small intestines, and large intestines, in that order. The stomach enzymatically digests food the majority of the way and also act as a food cache, storing large amounts of surplus food without immediately digesting all of it in cases where the Keevia comes across a large amount of food but insufficient water, as water is required for the hydrolysis reactions involved in digestion. The upper small intestines has a wider diameter than the lower small intestines, and is responsible for completing digestion, while the lower small intestines is where the majority of absorption occurs, with no separation of locations where different nutrients are absorbed. The large intestines are also responsible for nutrient absorption, but more importantly for water absorption.

^7 *This, along with most things mentioned in this chapter, describes what Keevia were originally adapted for. Modern Keevia tend to eat food that are less tough, and as a result, they are able to chew it more effectively.*

## Paws

Despite not having true hands, Keevias' front paws are quite dexterous and are capable of manipulating tools and objects extremely well. A Keevia's paws have exposed paw pads while most other species in the Equatorial Mountains have hooves or fur on the bottoms of their paws, as these provide a barrier between the potentially scorching sand. However, Keevias' paws have exposed pads for maximum dexterity and tactle information about the objects they touch. Their adaptation against the hot sand is simply to have the tissue of their paw pads heat resistant and insulative to protect the rest of the paw, with biomolecules specifically adapted to have a very high heat tolerance, combined with a much higher concentration of chemicals capable of endothermic reactions. Even so, the tissue has a high turnover rate in order to mitigate heat damage. They can still sense temperature reasonably precisely through their paws, but they can witstand very high temperatures before experiencing any pain or sustaining burn damage beyond acceptible levels.

## Sensory Adaptations

A Keevia's eyes have vertical elliptical pupils and are naturally resistant to the intense ambient light common in Keierian deserts, and is even capable of safely looking at the Keierian sun for small lengths of time. They are capable of detecting a wide range of light wavelengths. Their retinas contain five types of cone cells and can detect a continuous range from the standard water-transmissible wavelengths^8 to the long to medium wavelength ultraviolet range. Their irises are always a bright cyan, the same colour as their blood. This is due to a network of capillaries along the surface of the iris, which feed nutrients and oxygen to an array of infrared sensors. Modified rod cells on the surface of the iris, with the help of lens cells on top of them, detect the far infrared radiation associated with heat, allowing the eyes to form a rough thermal map over-top of the main image generated by the retinas. This thermal map has very low spatial and thermal resolution and cannot be used to construct any fine detail, but allows a Keevia to determine the temperatures of objects in their field of vision, a useful adaptation for determining the temperature of an object without touching it and for detecting animals at night when they're beyond the range of their antennae.

The Keevia's large ears are also very sensitive, and can detect a large range of sound frequencies. The tufts of fur lining the inside of the ears deflect sand and debris and also reduce the noise created by wind blowing past the ear canals.

^8 *These are the wavelengths humans can see.*

### Electromagnetic Sensing and Telepathy

Using the whisker antennae on their cheeks, Keevia can detect electromagnetic radiation. This allows them to detect the presence of other animals nearby based on the electrical currents generated by their neurons.

Keevia are one of the few intelligent species that are naturally capable of telepathy. They use their antennae to transmit and receive electromagnetic signals. Keevia are capable of telepathic empathy and conscious telepathic transmission. When two individuals are in range, they can choose to exchange some abstract ideas, which is most commonly used to augment spoken communication. It can help with explaining complex and/or abstract concepts or exchanging imagery, but it's not full mind reading as only what they intend to communicate is conveyed. Innate full mind reading abilities are exceedingly rare in known lifeforms.

Keevia are also very sensitive to emotions, even from those that are not telepathic themselves. For this reason, they are also described as empathic.

With effort and training, Keevia can enhance their telepathic abilities, including the detail of information transmitted and their effective range. With extreme effort and training, Keevia can achieve full mind reading where they can read other lifeforms' thoughts and mental states without the information being transmitted. However, this is an extremely rare practice due to the amount of effort required and because mind reading without explicit consent is illegal in the Maloran Republic and many other societies, and is seen by most as an extreme violation of privacy.

There is a slight sexual dichotomy where male Keevia have the lower two antennae shorter than the upper ones, while all four are the same length on females, as a staggered antenna morphology of males have been shown to be more effective for detecting the presence of other life forms, a useful trait in hunting and detecting intruders on one's territory, while the symmetric female morphology is more effective for telepathic communication by improving bi-directional signal integrity. This is consistent with the generally accepted theory that ancient Keevia lived in communes where males would be more likely to take on hunting, guarding and warrior roles whereas females tended to help coordinate the community.

Finally, an interesting fact about the Keevia's antennae is that they are comprised mostly of highly specialized nerve cells and nerve support cells, making Keevia one of the few species with exposed nerve tissue.

## Conclusion

Keevia are a very common species in the Maloran Republic, and their physiology is as interesting as they are common. The Keevia is just another example of the amazing complexity of life throughout the galaxy.

I'm building an application that shows nearby posts, where the range is configureable and doesn't have to be very precise, similar to tinder. Currently I'm mirroring all my documents to algolia and querying against that, which, as you can guess, isn't really the best option, since it's yet another third party service, is very expensive, and not really guaranteed to be in sync with firestore.

I've experimented a bit with geo-hashing and trying to implement it myself, but I couldn't really find a good explanation of the querying. I already created geohashes for all my docs, but I'm not sure how I can query within a radius. Also, how is this limited? Can I still use orderBy and other "where" statements?

2020-11-15 10:29:36 : TEETH : nihilisticgaz : https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/jujx6v/teeth/

I wait for you inside the old single-room shack, hidden behind an abandoned block of buildings on Main St. Far from the prying eyes of anyone passing by, but still close enough that I could change my mind.

If I wanted to.

Everyone knows about this place, the shack, but it's always empty. The adults know better than to venture in here. For kids, it's hallowed ground. A place where we can escape the world and drink, smoke, or fuck. Whatever we want to do. It's better for all concerned that it stays that way, a not-so-secret place for those of us that haven't yet entered into adulthood. I'm at the tail end of it, only weeks away from being an adult. Legally, anyway. But mentally? I'm still here, and I don't even know if it's possible for me to leave.

From the open doorway I watch Main St and the hustle and bustle of ordinary people doing ordinary things. A chill runs down my spine when I realize that pretty soon, I'll be exactly like them. Ordinary. But even so, not that many people are milling about town these days, even on Main St. This town is just about dead. It's been that way since all the industry moved offshore years ago, far away from here. There are some things in life that can't be overcome, and I guess this is one of them. Now everyone in town just kinda floats about, existing, waiting for the end of this shitty existence. A dead-end life in a dying town.

Which is why I'm here, waiting for you.

I light another smoke from the remains of another, working my way through the pack at a steady pace. I turn my back on the town one last time and step into the shack, closing the door behind me. With the door closed the ambient sounds from the outside world all compress into a dull, echoey whoosh. A holy place. Quiet. I flick the cigarette butt into a corner, watching the sparks create a perfect arc in the darkness. Nothing will catch fire in here, everything is either damp or already charred to a crisp. A cracked skylight in the ceiling is the only source of light now, above a filthy mattress in the centre of the room. The light never reaches the corners of the room, but it lights up the mattress so bright that it hurts my eyes to look at it. I walk towards it, through a cloud of lazy dust particles and kick an empty beer can across the room. I watch it roll across the splintered floorboards. It comes to an abrupt stop against your bare feet and my heart pounds like a sledgehammer to the chest.

I didn't even see you come in.

I'm positive the place was empty when I arrived, and there's no way you could have gotten past me. You step forward from a deep shadow and I get my first, and likely my last, look at you. Smaller than I expected. Wiry and dressed in clothes that could only have come from a dumpster dive. Your hair is the colour of engine oil. Dirty and full of knots, hanging limply all the way down to just below the curve of your breasts, obscuring most of your face.

I clear my throat and say "Hey", but you don't respond. You just stare at me like I'm fucking this whole thing up somehow. Which I probably am. I don't know how this is supposed to work. I guess I should have sorted out the details sooner, when we met online, but there's no time to think about that now. We're both here, and this thing is going to get done. One way or the other.

I take off my jacket and drop it onto the uneven, grimy floor boards, and sit down on the edge of the dirty mattress. It's the only stick of furniture in the place. It's torn, with foam poking out in a few spots with stains that run deep. Piss, alcohol, semen, and god knows what else. The smell of it makes my eyes water, like someone pissing onto a tire fire. I don't know how long it's been laying here, left to rot, but it's always been here. Just like the shack.

You step forward from the dark, into the blinding light, and stand over me. I want to look up at you, to take in every moment as fully as I can, but the sunlight stings my eyes so I look down at your dirt-encrusted feet instead. I close my eyes as you run your hands through my hair. I know I'm doing the right thing. The sane thing. I lay back, resting on my elbows, while you climb on top of me. Straddling me. My body reacts instantly, my hard-on threatening to burst through my jeans. I don't have the time to figure out if it's my death fetish or just the weight of you on top of me.

I look up just in time to see you open your mouth, showing me dual rows of jagged teeth. It takes my breath away, it might be the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. The light hits them at that perfect angle, images of broken bottles and used razorblades slicing through soft flesh race through my mind. Your jaws open wider and don't stop until it's no longer a mouth, it's a maw. I stare deep into it, down your throat, but I get lost in there so I squeeze my eyes shut. I want to pray, I feel like I should, but when has *that* ever helped anyone?

When I open my eyes again your face is only inches away from mine. Your eyes are two, perfect pools of black ink, your skin pale and unmarked. I reach out to touch it, to feel you. So delicate and wafer-thin, like centuries old silk. I almost can't believe you're a killer.

Almost.

It's the teeth that give it away. Kind of hard to look anything other than dangerous when you have a mouth like that. Dozens of tiny, sharpened knives where your teeth should be.

Your smell stirs something inside me so I move my head closer, to take you deep into my lungs. It's intoxicating. Like blood and ethanol. I start to squirm underneath you, high on your scent. You push down on me harder, pinning me against the filth of the rotten mattress.

I turn my head away and pull down the collar of my shirt, exposing the soft flesh of my neck and throat. You don't waste any time. Your teeth dig into my throat, biting through flesh and muscle. I want to push you away but I fight against my survival instinct, and instead I lean into it. The pain receptors in my body start firing off and I start to spasm. Every second is more agonizing than the last, but the weight of you bearing down on me only makes me harder.

When you release my throat I drop back onto the mattress. A rush consumes me and fills me to the brim. It's unlike any other drug I've taken, and I'm pretty sure I've tried them all. You rock back and forth, still straddling me, as you run your hands over your face and chest. Smearing my blood all over while chewing on whatever it was you ripped from my throat.

It's too late to take it back, to change my mind. Not that I ever considered trying. After all, I asked *you* for this.

I want this every bit as much as you.

Maybe even more.

Lately I've just been slipping deeper and deeper into this pit that just feels so hard to escape. Even switching medications, talk to people about it, and trying to get out I just feel less and less like myself. Like something is slowly chipping away at my personality and happiness. I don't want to play the games I use to play enjoy or even some of my core hobbies. It all feels like its lost its spark ... or maybe I have. I'm sorry if it sounds stereotypical but I can't put it any other way. I'm tired. I just want to sleep everything away.

the overbloated cast is  problem in RWBY. too many characters in the same story make hard focus on the right ones. Volume 6-7 and the start of Volume 8 are a good example of this.

but the problem could have been fixed some Volumes ago. Team JRN have done little to nothing in the last Volumes, tehir subplots were usless and just a waste of screen time.

my idea is. at the start of Volume 6 afetr Leo's betrayal Ozpin ask JRN to go to Vacuo and secure the Relic of Destruction, while him, Qrow and Team RWBY go to Atlas. their mission in Mistral is over, Cidner is dead (or so they think) and Pyrrha is been avenged.

in this way they can disappear for a couple of Volumes or have some dedicated Episodes to their Journey to Vacuo. So we can focus more on the reunion of Team RWBY, and still give JRN space to shine in their hwon way.

#**MYTHS about Buddhism, distorted by bhimtas and Boobasaheb EXPOSED**



#Career, this was very much hindu, and varna hindu at that. Jai Parshuram🚩🚩🚩!!!!

 

At 29, he renounced society, but not Hinduism. Indeed, it is a typical thing among Hindus to exit from society, laying off your caste marks including your civil name. The Rg-Veda already describes the Muni-s as having matted hair and going about sky-clad: such are what we now know as Naga Sadhus. Asceticism was a recognized practice in Vedic society long before the Buddha. Yajnavalkya, the Upanishadic originator of the notion of Self, renounced life in society after a successful career as court priest and an equally happy family life with two wives. By leaving his family and renouncing his future in politics, the Buddha followed an existing tradition within Hindu society. He didn’t practice Vedic rituals anymore, which is normal for a Vedic renunciate (though Zen Buddhists still recite the Heart Sutra in the Vedic fashion, ending with “sowaka”, i.e. svaha). He was a late follower of a movement very much in evidence in the Upanishads, viz. of spurning rituals (Karmakanda) in favour of knowledge (Jnanakanda). After he had done the Hindu thing by going to the forest, he tried several methods, including the techniques he learned from two masters and which did not fully satisfy him,-- but nonetheless enough to include them in his own and the Buddhist curriculum. Among other techniques, he practised Anapanasati, “attention to the breathing process”, the archetypal yoga practice popular in practically all yoga schools till today. For a while he also practised an extreme form of asceticism, still existing in the Hindu sect of Jainism. He exercised his Hindu freedom to join a sect devoted to certain techniques, and later the freedom to leave it, remaining a Hindu at every stage.

 

He then added a technique of his own, or at least that is what the Buddhist sources tell us, for in the paucity of reliable information, we don’t know for sure that he hadn’t learned the Vipassana (“mindfulness”) technique elsewhere. Unless evidence of the contrary comes to the surface, we assume that he invented this technique all by himself, as a Hindu is free to do. He then achieved Bodhi, the “Awakening”. By his own admission, he was by no means the first to do so. Instead, he had only walked the same path of other Awakened beings before him.

 

At the bidding of the Vedic gods Brahma and Indra, he left his self-contained state of Awakening and started teaching his way to others. When he “set in motion the wheel of the Law” (Dharma-cakra-pravartana, Chinese Falungong), he gave no indication whatsoever of breaking with an existing system. On the contrary, by his use of existing Vedic and Upanishadic terminology (Arya, “Vedically civilized”; Dharma), he confirmed his Vedic roots and implied that his system was a restoration of the Vedic ideal which had become degenerate. He taught his techniques and his analysis of the human condition to his disciples, promising them to achieve the same Awakening if they practiced these diligently. 

 

 

#Caste

 

On caste, we find him is full cooperation with existing caste society. Being an elitist, he mainly recruited among the upper castes, with over 40% Brahmins. These would later furnish all the great philosophers who made Buddhism synonymous with conceptual sophistication. Conversely, the Buddhist universities trained well-known non-Buddhist scientists such as the astronomer Aryabhata. Lest the impression be created that universities are a gift of Buddhism to India, it may be pointed out that the Buddha’s friends Bandhula and Prasenadi (and, according to a speculation, maybe the young Siddhartha himself) had studied at the university of Takshashila, clearly established before there were any Buddhists around to do so. Instead, the Buddhists greatly developed an institution which they had inherited from Hindu society.

 

The kings and magnates of the eastern Ganga plain treated the Buddha as one of their own (because that is what he was) and gladly patronized his fast-growing monastic order, commanding their servants and subjects to build a network of monasteries for it. He predicted the coming of a future Awakened leader like himself, the Maitreya (“the one practising friendship/charity”), and specified that he would be born in a Brahmin family. When king Prasenadi discovered that his wife was not a Shakya princess but the daughter of the Shakya ruler by a maid-servant, he repudiated her and their son; but his friend the Buddha made him take them back.

 

Did he achieve this by saying that birth is unimportant, that “caste is bad” or that “caste doesn’t matter”, as the Ambedkarites claim? No, he reminded the king of the old view (then apparently in the process of being replaced with a stricter view) that caste was passed on exclusively in the paternal line. Among hybrids of horses and donkeys, the progeny of a horse stallion and a donkey mare whinnies, like its father, while the progeny of a donkey stallion and a horse mare brays, also like its father. So, in the oldest Upanishad, Satyakama Jabala is accepted by his Brahmins-only teacher because his father is deduced to be a Brahmin, regardless of his mother being a maid-servant. And similarly, king Prasenadi should accept his son as a Kshatriya, eventhough his mother was not a full-blooded Shakya Kshatriya.

 

When he died, the elites of eight cities made a successful bid for his ashes on the plea: "We are Kshatriyas, he was a Kshatriya, therefore we have a right to his ashes". After almost half a century, his disciples didn’t mind being seen in public as still observing caste in a context which was par excellence Buddhist. The reason is that the Buddha in his many teachings never had told them to give up caste, e.g. to give their daughters in marriage to men of other castes. This was perfectly logical: as a man with a spiritual message, the Buddha wanted to lose as little time as possible on social matters. If satisfying your own miserable desires is difficult enough, satisfying the desire for an egalitarian society provides an endless distraction from your spiritual practice.

Hey all,

I am currently studying for the AZ-104 administrator course and have been doing a few question banks from Whizzlabs.

I have been looking through the Azure/MS documentation on this point and I can not find a clear table or post that lays out the extra features that you get between the following:

&amp;#x200B;

* Application gateway Standard (v2)
* Application gateway with WAF (v2)

Does the application gateway standard simply not provide any protection in regards to application exploits? I assume the standard application gateway protects against DDoS?

Thanks

Hi, Reddit. So here goes. 

I just ended things with my bf (21M) of 2 years. We have been through a lot together and were generally happy until the past couple of months. School and the virus have hit my mental health very hard. 

I ended things so I could take time to get my mental health together and learn healthy habits. I feel like I need to be able to take care of myself before I can take care of anybody else. 

Both of us still love each other, and it was a very sad and painful event. But now that it happened, I’m realizing that maybe I need him to help me through this. He is very good at helping me and understanding when I’m feeling unwell. I am wanting to take a period of about a month to myself to adjust my medication and start seeing a therapist. Is this unfair to ask of him? Am I holding him back? Am I a horrible person?

I just can’t imagine going through life without him, but right now I have got to take care of me. I don’t know what to do. I feel like a burden to him because I’ve been so stressed out lately, and it’s not his job to manage my mental well-being and help me. I am planning on starting therapy and adjusting my medication.

This just happened, less than 5 minutes ago. Thunderstorm just woke me up, so I got out of bed but hadn’t put my glasses on yet. As I went to open the door I saw my sons white cat inside my room by the door. I did a double take and the cat was gone. Opened the door and the cat was in the mirror position on the other side of the door. You might be thinking, oh, he went under the door, or slid a paw under. Noop. Carpeted floor, air seal door jambs in a pitch black room and the cat is a white Persian. Also of note the door hinges are squeaky af because I am a light sleeper and I don’t like being surprised so I use it as a cheap alarm. My second glitch this month that was noteworthy...I also had a 2020 morning without my glasses a couple weeks ago. I’ll talk about that if anyone is interested.

        public Integer Id;
    
        @Column(unique = true)
        public String username;
        public String role;
}
    
    @org.springframework.data.relational.core.mapping.Table
    public class SandwichDbModel implements Serializable, Persistable&lt;Integer&gt; {
    
        private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
    
        @org.springframework.data.annotation.Id

        public Integer Id;
        @Column(unique=true)

        public String type;
        public double stock;
        public String unitOfMeasurement;
        public String uri;
}


When I start the application, if I check the H2 database it worked, he created the correct table  


    OrderDbModel
    | ID   | DATE | ORDER_ID | ORDER_QUANTITY | UNIT_OF_MEASUREMENT | A_ID | B_ID |
    | ---- | ---- | -------- | -------------- | ------------------- | ---- | ---- |
    |      |      |          |                |                     |      |      |
    
    UserDbModel
    | ID   | ROLE | USERNAME |
    | ---- | ---- | -------- |
    |      |      |          |
    
    SandwichDbModel
    | ID   | DESCRIPTION | DESIGNATION | STOCK | TYPE | UNIT_OF_MEASUREMENT | URI  |
    | ---- | ----------- | ----------- | ----- | ---- | ------------------- | ---- |
    |      |             |             |       |      |                     |      |
    
    

And when I add Users and Sandwichs everything works fine, but when I try to insert a Order, he throws an exception because he is trying to put a OrderID into table UserDbModel

&amp;#x200B;

    org.h2.jdbc.JdbcSQLSyntaxErrorException: Column "ORDER_DB_MODEL" not found; SQL statement:
    INSERT INTO "USER_DB_MODEL" ("ID", "ORDER_DB_MODEL", "ROLE", "USERNAME") VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?) [42122-200]

How can he generate the correct table but doesn't know how to save the OrderDbModel?

Any help is appreciated

2020-11-15 10:31:22 : How would you handle 2x4TB, 2x2TB and 4x1TB of storage? : Bakonblak : https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/jujxtz/how_would_you_handle_2x4tb_2x2tb_and_4x1tb_of/

Hey all, I'm slowly migrating things into a dedicated rack mounted server chassis and have two questions on my mind.  


Firstly, as the title states, what would you do with the storage I have?  
My current thinking is:

- 4x1TB = RAID-0 = VirtualDrive 1 (4TB)
- 2x2TB = RAID-0 = VirtualDrive 2 (4TB)
- 1x4TB = PhysicalDrive1 (4TB)
- 1x4TB = PhysicalDrive2 (4TB)

and then combine them all together in RAID-4 to create a 1x4TB VirtualDrive, as I currently don't store THAT much data and would prefer reliability.
Would you do it any differently? Is my logic there flawed?

If my logic wasn't flawed, then it might be here as my second question is as so:
I currently don't have somewhere to mount the 4x1TB drives and don't want them loose - so is it possible to RAID-3 as outlined above (without the 1TB's) and then upgrade to RAID-4 later when I get the mount, or is it best to wait until I have it all?

Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I've been doing an Android Developer internship with a company in Amsterdam lately, and should get my software engineering degree in the following months (not from a Dutch university). The company might offer me a contract to continue working with them, and since this would be my first time discussing a job contract, I have no idea what to expect, especially that I'm not from the Netherlands.  


Can you please let me know what salary should I expect for such a position? Is it normal to ask for a salary that let me fully benefit from the 30% ruling? Do I fall into the category of "Young employee with master" for the 30% ruling (I'm younger then 30)? Is there any other tax allowances I should be aware of besides the 30% ruling?  


Any other contract discussion tips or guidance are highly appreciated.

Thanks all.

So I've played this gsme when I was ~6-7 years old but I found it too complicated. It was an adventure game where I had to solve problems to progress. The only thing I remember that there was a yellow submarine which could be activated with a big magnet. But the magnet should be turned on first. In the water with the submarine there were some kind of bombs with eyes. Maybe the main antagonist wore a red cap. Honestly I have very few memories about this game, but I remember that I promised myself to try it again when I grow up.

I have been posting a lot in the vein of suggestions, so I wanted to put a quick post out to express how good this game is in my estimation.

I fully intent to continue to write a ton of suggestions, if not specifically to devs, but maybe to offer inspiration to certain mod authors who have more knowledge then I do on lua scripting and barring the developers coming to my home and throwing me out of a 40 story building to stop me 

( something that would be even harder considering I do not live in a building of this description... on account of this I believe the devs would have to put in quite a bit of effort in terms of relocating my body 

( I imagine I would need to be rendered unconscious for transportation, because while I am no spring chicken, there is no way I would surrender myself without a great fuss, which I believe would prove to be in the very least a minor nuisance and at most I could see myself prevailing in so forth that I make the aforementioned procurement of myself quite a large hassle!) 

I have developed a plan in the event that I would be notified of any kind of plan for insurrection that I hope will illuminate my preparation in the event that I am to be silenced for my suggestions that involves three major steps

step one: 

\- The first six months would be the most difficult in the process as it requires a good deal of  reconnaissance on my part. I would most likely start small by changing my name, and moving even farther away from my current location in NY state to somewhere much more remote (and consequently farther away from any buildings that the devs might attempt to throw me out of for posting too many suggestions) somewhere probably in Canada.

with my new name I would spend the next four or five months learning the lay of the land as well as picking up several new languages in order to supplant myself into the local aristocracy, hoping to make a new name for myself as an old timey tax collector named... ah you almost thought I would reveal my name... see I thought of everything.

After becoming fluent in Irish, Italian, French, German, Korean, and Arabic. I think I would have enough standing with the local government to call for an organized rally against the fast food industry. 

Why would I do all this?

I am glad you asked.

With fast food as the the number one topic of Canadian correspondence I would have a window of opportunity to make my escape.. (I assume by now The indie stone would be hot on my tail... and if my calculations are correct, I would be leaving my backdoor just as the devs entered the front hallway, and right when they think they found me sitting in my arm chair facing the main  fenestra found in my elaborate study, they would be sadly disappointed to find a note sitting in the chair next to a lit cigar that reads "  mere liye duniya kay anya sabhi darvaje khule hann daen? " an obvious reference to the 1970's cult classic 'Mera Naam Joker' that topically and lightly exposes the hypocrisy, and and futility of any attempts to live a truly happy life in a cruel and unforgiving world, whilst also begging the question as to what we as mere flesh and blood could possibly hope to achieve without the close connection with those whom we choose to love.

This would obviously give me a short window of time to gather up any remaining supporters to my cause of not getting thrown out a window and heading into phase two of my escape plan, where I must travel into the belly of beast itself. The "Tanami Desert", who's name is thought to be an anglicisation of the Walpri name for the area "Chanamee" which means "never die" ( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanami\_Desert#:\~:text=The%20name%20Tanami%20is%20thought%20to%20be%20an,desert%20which%20were%20said%20never%20to%20run%20dry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanami_Desert#:~:text=The%20name%20Tanami%20is%20thought%20to%20be%20an,desert%20which%20were%20said%20never%20to%20run%20dry).)  


I can imagine any reader of this article may be asking themselves, why? why go to Tanami of all places?

HA a laughable yet incontemptible inquisition!

The idea of hiding of seeking assylum in Australia dates back to its rooted conception as a nation and as fortune would hold there is quite a laundry list of eligible professions allouted to those who wish to procure citizenship within its bowels.

&amp;#x200B;

For reference and further illumination of my careful planning to avoid the inevitable drop from any uncanny heights at the behest of the illusive and sundry Indie stone, feel free to read through the full policy list yourself, but we are mostly interested in most recent addendum to the list of recognized positions necessary for integration.

Tennis Coach... this this was the final missing piece to puzzle.

I will move to the Australian desert and live out my life in seclusion as a thriving tennis coach with a band of 40-50 like minded individuals all the while writing suggestions to project zomboid until the day that I myself perish in a forest fire in northern Kentucky because the devs added in this feature to ensure my in-game demise..... well played indie stone.)

&amp;#x200B;

what was I talking about?

&amp;#x200B;

Oh yeah the game!

I love this game and I think its got some of the best atmosphere and all the hardcore mechanics I am looking for in a survival zombie game. Cant wait for multiplayer!

2020-11-15 10:32:53 : Big Sur - Black Screen after successful install + Reboot [ASUS TUF X570+5700XT] : Geekdomo : https://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/jujydn/big_sur_black_screen_after_successful_install/

I fresh installed Catalina then updated from Catalina to Big Sur with absolutely NO issues. After installing all of my email, programs, etc I needed to reboot. After reboot it went to a black screen. I adjusted my plist a few times with no result. Added and removed several graphics related flags, nothing. Booted fine but black screen (could hear beep when typing so I was in the OS). Tried swapping monitors and ports- nothing.   


Solution - Go into your MOTHERBOARD Bios and look for SERIAL PORT - ENABLE/DISABLE. On the ASUS TUF X570 its under Advanced -&gt; Serial Configuration -&gt; Serial Port. Switched to Disable and rebooted. At login screen in around 20 seconds. Hope this helps someone out there getting stuck with this.

2020-11-15 10:33:02 : textbook + story/fiction books : throwwwawwway56 : https://www.reddit.com/r/dubai/comments/jujyfd/textbook_storyfiction_books/

I have many physical copies of young adult/classics/literature/kids books that I bought from kinokuniya and borders. I also have a bunch of textbooks for various levels (SATs, ACTs, UKCAT, IGCSE/GCSE, IB). 

I want to sell the textbooks and some other books - they are all in really good condition (only read once or twice). Where can I possibly sell them? I've never used dubbizle so I was just wondering if that works for books too? If there are any other websites I can sell them on please let me know. 

Also, where can I donate fictional books for kids? 

Thank you!

2020-11-15 10:33:18 : Credit card fraud? Or honest mistake? What differentiates it? : throwaway9232131 : https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladviceofftopic/comments/jujyis/credit_card_fraud_or_honest_mistake_what/

State-florida. I don't have the money to consult an attorney, so i'm asking here.

I understand both at a state, and more often, federal level, lying on a credit card application is considered loan (correct me if i'm wrong) application fraud/ credit card fraud. It is also sometimes a couple other crimes.

However, from what i've researched the word "knowingly" lying or "knowingly" misrepresenting your income for example.

About a year ago i applied for a credit card. I have decent credit, not too much history, and at the time i wasn't even employed. I applied for a capital one card and recieved a 0% interest card. I put 4000 dollars on it, and my family helped me pay the minimum payment.

I called capital one, on a recorded line and asked if on the part where it asks "whats your income" if i can include my families income. I read something that stated you can include families income if their income will be included in helping pay your bills. So the representative told me as long as my family was going to help me pay it, i could include their income. Following the representatives advice, i put 80k income. Despite being unemployed. I was approved for a card with an 8k limit (and like i said put 4k on it.)

About 4 months later or so, covid hits, and my dad quits his job paying about 80k a year because of the fact my mom and i have compromised immune systems. So there goes that 80k helping us pay bills. Now in about 4 months i will have a 4k credit card and no possible way to pay it. So i will likely file a chapter 7 on this. I'm assuming they will ask what happened and to my income.

If i explained all these things, the way i just worded it, that ISN'T fraud, because i didn't INTENTIONALLY lie, i followed what a representative told me, right? I don't have the persons name, or when i talked to them.(from capital one)

2020-11-15 10:33:47 : DAC for Gainclone : JVKran : https://www.reddit.com/r/BudgetAudiophile/comments/jujyoj/dac_for_gainclone/

Hi there!

**Question**

I've finished my LM3886 Gainclone last weekend and used it as my daily driver last week. The gainclone is driving my pair of DIY'ed C-Note Speakers by the way. All in all, I'm very impressed!

To step up my game, I thought it would be a good idea to add a DAC to the setup. The built-in DAC of my laptop (through which I listen to music mostly), isn't that great.

**Details**

\- I'm not really into spending more than €300,-; that'd be more than AMP and Speakers combined...

\- It'll be for listening to music mostly. A little bit of gaming too, but don't have much time for it at the moment. Practically none really and won't have any time soon.

\- USB input and RCA output is enough. I won't be using bluetooth or headphones. Nevertheless, I don't mind having these.

\- It'd be nice to have it located on a desk.

\- I live in The Netherlands and can buy from practically anywhere that I know of ([amazon.com/de/nl](https://amazon.com/de/nl), aliexpress, [bol.com](https://bol.com), coolblue).

**Research**

I've also done some research on my own and I'm kinda torn between two options (I'm open to other suggestions as well though!). 

The Dragonfly Red in combination with Tidal or the Topping E30 in combination with Qobuz. The Dragonfly could go well with Tidal since it supports MQA and the standard CD-quality. I like the Topping more (and feel like you get more bang for your buck), but feel like I wouldn't be using all of everything it has to offer when using it with Tidal; then it would be playing CD quality only. That's why I feel like it's more worth it with Qobuz; just hi-res up to 24/192 without MQA. Do you think it's worth using a non-MQA DAC with Tidal? If not, what MQA DAC do you suggest?

One catch however, is that I'm a student software/electrical engineering and can subscribe to Tidal Hifi for just €10,- a month while Qobuz is €20,- a month. I don't prefer Tidal over Qobuz or the other way around, I'm just looking to get the most out of my purchase for a good amount of time.

I'd like to know your opinion on the matter and of course I'm also open to other suggestions!

2020-11-15 10:34:25 : 24 [F4R] SA/Anywhere - If there's anyone I relate to the most it's Alice in Wonderland. : MadeofMint : https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/jujyw1/24_f4r_saanywhere_if_theres_anyone_i_relate_to/

She too keeps eating and drinking in the hopes that it'll solve all her problems. Big mood.

Anyway! I'm a 20 something artist, not starving but not fully thriving. I don't believe in cookies and milk but I do believe in hot chocolate and marshmallows.

My favourite thing about me is the dimple on my right cheek.

My least favorite thing about me is that my natural response to a physical task that I cannot accomplish, such as opening a really tightly sealed container is to burst into laughter and make myself even weaker and far less likely to succeed.

What do I want?

Someone I can actually have conversations with. I know most of us on the Internet are fairly introverted. I can be introverted at times too! But I'm tired of meeting folk where its like trying to get water out of a rock just to get the conversation rolling beyond how are you? 

I have no expectations of love and romantic partnership. Frankly, going into any conversation with that expectation is a tad psychotic. Maybe see if you actually like a person before you start building castles in the sky?

I'm going to spam you with cute pictures of my cat, all my cutest selfies and works in progress for my art. I expect equal spammage of things that you'd like to share too!

Oh this is a big one: Voice calls &gt; texting. If you're the kind of person that talks exclusively on text, chances are this will fizzle off because I get distracted and caught up in painting or something. I prefer to get on calls when we're both comfortable doing so (doesn't have to be right away at all) 

As such, reddit is right at the bottom of all the places I want to chat haha. If you decide you'd like to talk send me a PM (not a chat request please!) with something about yourself and what platform would work for us to chat on! 

Maybe we can drink and eat our problems away together. We might not find wonderland, but at least we'll have a good time looking :)

2) shadow people

3) vanishing items

some speak about other universes. some others speak about glitches in matrix.

i have two cats, they both scratch at their ears a lot, so my mom told me to use human eardrops on both of them, so i did, until i realized i made two mistakes:

1- i used eye drops by accident.

2- i looked up the ingredients online (antazoline, tetrahydrozoline, benzalkonium chloride) and found that antazoline and tetrahydrozoline are possibly poisonous.

what do i do??

Hi there! Thank you for the awesome app. After updating to the Big Sur with its "spacious design" and ridiculous waste of space between menu bar icons, I'm removing every icon I can. However, hiding Wallpaperer icon from the menu bar completely removes the possibility to see the wallpaper info.

Would it be sensible to diplicate the popup contents somewhere in the preferences window - for those who turns off the icon but still checks the info occasionally?

2020-11-15 10:35:01 : TEETH : nihilisticgaz : https://www.reddit.com/r/WritersOfHorror/comments/jujz3q/teeth/

I wait for you inside the old single-room shack, hidden behind an abandoned block of buildings on Main St. Far from the prying eyes of anyone passing by, but still close enough that I could change my mind.

If I wanted to.

Everyone knows about this place, the shack, but it's always empty. The adults know better than to venture in here. For kids, it's hallowed ground. A place where we can escape the world and drink, smoke, or fuck. Whatever we want to do. It's better for all concerned that it stays that way, a not-so-secret place for those of us that haven't yet entered into adulthood. I'm at the tail end of it, only weeks away from being an adult. Legally, anyway. But mentally? I'm still here, and I don't even know if it's possible for me to leave.

From the open doorway I watch Main St and the hustle and bustle of ordinary people doing ordinary things. A chill runs down my spine when I realize that pretty soon, I'll be exactly like them. Ordinary. But even so, not that many people are milling about town these days, even on Main St. This town is just about dead. It's been that way since all the industry moved offshore years ago, far away from here. There are some things in life that can't be overcome, and I guess this is one of them. Now everyone in town just kinda floats about, existing, waiting for the end of this shitty existence. A dead-end life in a dying town.

Which is why I'm here, waiting for you.

I light another smoke from the remains of another, working my way through the pack at a steady pace. I turn my back on the town one last time and step into the shack, closing the door behind me. With the door closed the ambient sounds from the outside world all compress into a dull, echoey whoosh. A holy place. Quiet. I flick the cigarette butt into a corner, watching the sparks create a perfect arc in the darkness. Nothing will catch fire in here, everything is either damp or already charred to a crisp. A cracked skylight in the ceiling is the only source of light now, above a filthy mattress in the centre of the room. The light never reaches the corners of the room, but it lights up the mattress so bright that it hurts my eyes to look at it. I walk towards it, through a cloud of lazy dust particles and kick an empty beer can across the room. I watch it roll across the splintered floorboards. It comes to an abrupt stop against your bare feet and my heart pounds like a sledgehammer to the chest.

I didn't even see you come in.

I'm positive the place was empty when I arrived, and there's no way you could have gotten past me. You step forward from a deep shadow and I get my first, and likely my last, look at you. Smaller than I expected. Wiry and dressed in clothes that could only have come from a dumpster dive. Your hair is the colour of engine oil. Dirty and full of knots, hanging limply all the way down to just below the curve of your breasts, obscuring most of your face.

I clear my throat and say "Hey", but you don't respond. You just stare at me like I'm fucking this whole thing up somehow. Which I probably am. I don't know how this is supposed to work. I guess I should have sorted out the details sooner, when we met online, but there's no time to think about that now. We're both here, and this thing is going to get done. One way or the other.

I take off my jacket and drop it onto the uneven, grimy floor boards, and sit down on the edge of the dirty mattress. It's the only stick of furniture in the place. It's torn, with foam poking out in a few spots with stains that run deep. Piss, alcohol, semen, and god knows what else. The smell of it makes my eyes water, like someone pissing onto a tire fire. I don't know how long it's been laying here, left to rot, but it's always been here. Just like the shack.

You step forward from the dark, into the blinding light, and stand over me. I want to look up at you, to take in every moment as fully as I can, but the sunlight stings my eyes so I look down at your dirt-encrusted feet instead. I close my eyes as you run your hands through my hair. I know I'm doing the right thing. The sane thing. I lay back, resting on my elbows, while you climb on top of me. Straddling me. My body reacts instantly, my hard-on threatening to burst through my jeans. I don't have the time to figure out if it's my death fetish or just the weight of you on top of me.

I look up just in time to see you open your mouth, showing me dual rows of jagged teeth. It takes my breath away, it might be the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. The light hits them at that perfect angle, images of broken bottles and used razorblades slicing through soft flesh race through my mind. Your jaws open wider and don't stop until it's no longer a mouth, it's a maw. I stare deep into it, down your throat, but I get lost in there so I squeeze my eyes shut. I want to pray, I feel like I should, but when has *that* ever helped anyone?

When I open my eyes again your face is only inches away from mine. Your eyes are two, perfect pools of black ink, your skin pale and unmarked. I reach out to touch it, to feel you. So delicate and wafer-thin, like centuries old silk. I almost can't believe you're a killer.

Almost.

It's the teeth that give it away. Kind of hard to look anything other than dangerous when you have a mouth like that. Dozens of tiny, sharpened knives where your teeth should be.

Your smell stirs something inside me so I move my head closer, to take you deep into my lungs. It's intoxicating. Like blood and ethanol. I start to squirm underneath you, high on your scent. You push down on me harder, pinning me against the filth of the rotten mattress.

I turn my head away and pull down the collar of my shirt, exposing the soft flesh of my neck and throat. You don't waste any time. Your teeth dig into my throat, biting through flesh and muscle. I want to push you away but I fight against my survival instinct, and instead I lean into it. The pain receptors in my body start firing off and I start to spasm. Every second is more agonizing than the last, but the weight of you bearing down on me only makes me harder.

When you release my throat I drop back onto the mattress. A rush consumes me and fills me to the brim. It's unlike any other drug I've taken, and I'm pretty sure I've tried them all. You rock back and forth, still straddling me, as you run your hands over your face and chest. Smearing my blood all over while chewing on whatever it was you ripped from my throat.

It's too late to take it back, to change my mind. Not that I ever considered trying. After all, I asked *you* for this.

I want this every bit as much as you.

Maybe even more.

2020-11-15 10:34:57 : T3N, Germany: "Fraunhofer super battery brings electric cars a range of 1,000 to 2,000 kilometers" : TheAce0 : https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/jujz2z/t3n_germany_fraunhofer_super_battery_brings/

Article Link (German):  [https://t3n.de/news/fraunhofer-super-akku-e-autos-1337689/](https://t3n.de/news/fraunhofer-super-akku-e-autos-1337689/) 

Translation via DeepL + Google Translate:

**The German Fraunhofer institute, in collaboration with The Netherlands Organization, has developed a battery technology that allows much longer ranges and much shorter charging times.**

The novel battery technology called "Spatial Atom Layer Deposition" (SALD) is expected to provide electric cars with a range of far more than 1,000 kilometers. The technology was developed in a joint project of the German Fraunhofer institute and the Dutch state research institution The Netherlands Organisation (TNO). 

## SALD technology is about to be launched

The development has progressed so far that a company has already been founded to advance industrial mass production. This is SALD BV, which is based in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. According to its own statements, the company is already overwhelmed by requests from investors.

The highlight of the super battery is the patented " Spatial Atom Layer Deposition" process. This process allows ultra-thin coatings, or so-called atomic coatings, to be applied on an industrial scale. The SALD batteries produced in this way not only enable three times the range of today's battery cells in a similarly large installation space.

According to SALD BV, they can also be charged at five times the speed. An electric car could thus be fully charged within ten minutes to about 80 percent and fully charged in twenty minutes.

According to SALD boss Frank Verhage, the first cars will be equipped with the new batteries from 2022. Talks with various car manufacturers are already being held.

## SALD atomic coatings work with all cathode materials

The SALD batteries initially represent a further development of today's lithium-ion technology. The nano-coating creates a so-called “Artificial Solid-Electrolyte Interphase” (A-SEI), which should have a significantly better performance compared to previous SEI.

This should not only affect the capacity and the charging speed \[but also\] benefit durability and safety.

SALD technology should also work with solid-state batteries that are currently being developed. That would significantly improve security. In general, the atom-thin three-dimensional surface coating should work with all cathode materials that are currently in the consideration, test or production phase at battery manufacturers. Tesla's new lithium iron phosphate batteries, which are used for the Model 3, could also benefit from SALD technology.

But even with the first version of the SALD battery, CEO Verhage promises that an “e-car can drive well over 1000 kilometers with smaller batteries or even over 2000 kilometers with larger battery packs without recharging”.

It is not about theoretical range records, but about a battery that is suitable for everyday use and that has at least 20 to 30 percent remaining charge after 1,000 kilometers, even with a sporty, dynamic driving style and air conditioning or heating, according to Verhage.

## Batteries also suitable for other consumers

The technology is not only suitable for electric cars, but also for smartphones, smartwatches and other battery-operated devices. SALD batteries could provide smartphones that only need to be charged once a week.

SALD BV claims that it already has all the necessary patents and has production machines for small series in operation.

2020-11-15 10:35:13 : Counselor and realizing you’re an addict? : Steve1081 : https://www.reddit.com/r/AddictionAdvice/comments/jujz64/counselor_and_realizing_youre_an_addict/

Hello, I’m a 29 year old who began working as a substance use counselor 3 years ago. Helping those struggling has always been important to me as, like most, the disease has impacted some of my closest loved ones greatly. When I received this position I was ecstatic to help others. Looking back though, I knew in the back of my mind that I was very vulnerable to this disease. Check that,  I believe I knew in the back of my mind somewhere that I was an addict. I was waiting for a shoe to drop. 

Stimulants (adderall mostly) have called my name since college. I’ve gone through prolonged periods of abstinence (really just lack of access). Up to 2 years. My first 2 years on this job I was sober and felt good. About a year ago I was given total access (a neighbor) to the pills. I’ve begun realizing indiscriminate sex is becoming co-morbid.  Together, they getting in the way of the relationships I’d like to have. I’m nearly 30 years old. 

Problem is, very few people know this of me. A few friends....who also use. Trust me when I tell you though, others are beginning to catch on. I’ve begun using up to 90 mg of adderall nearly everyday. The days I don’t use I am a zombie. Hell, what began as a productive drug has begun to make me borderline useless even when I’m on it. My superiors at work have started to notice that something is up. I believe that they are chalking my rapid decline in productivity up to covid depression. While this may be true, it has only exacerbated a problem that has really existed all along. Not a result of COVID (although it doesn’t help) but a me problem that I feel I need to deal with now before it gets even worse. I believe I am powerless. 

These are easy things to say. Problem is, I’m terrified of being seen as a phony. I’m terrified of losing my job. I realize Addicts in Recovery are even better suited for this line of work. But what about someone who realized they were an addict on the job? “Just there for the paycheck probably”? Thats what I’m petrified of people thinking. 

However I know I need help and I think an inpatient facility would be my best option. There are coworkers I trust but would be weary sharing with some management the extent of this (government agency). I would like to be careful not to overshare. I love what I do and am good at it when my cup is full. An ever-present sense of guilt looms over me knowing that my cup is running on fumes right now and I’m not giving my clients the help they deserve. 

Any advice would be so helpful and thank you all so much. How do I go about this?

# The Physiology of Aliens: Keevia

*Adapted and translated from chapter 8.2.5 of the Exobiology Encyclopedia published by the Maloran Science Institute. Originally written by Doctor Taza Katatai, an exobiologist, medical officer for the Maloran Space Fleet, and a Keevia himself.*

Keevia (alternative spelling: Kievia) are a small quadrupedal species originating from the planet Malorus (formerly Keierus^(1)). They have a mean adult standing height from their paws to ear tips of 37 centimetres, length excluding the tail of 55 centimetres, and weight of 4 to 6 kilograms. Keevia are adapted for desert life, as their home planet is composed mostly of such an environment. The Keevia species addressed in this chapter is officially called the Mountain Keevia, so named because they most likely evolved in the equatorial mountains of Malorus. This is the only Keevia species that are not extinct and also the only one to have ever attained any sort of higher intelligence^(2). In this book, "Keevia" refers to Mountain Keevia unless otherwise specified.

This species is unique as the first and currently only known quadruped to have independently become not only space faring but an interplanetary species, without influence from other alien life forms. Keevia have an average General Lifeform Intelligence Index of 9.3, in theory making them one of the most cognitively intelligent known species. However, as we explored in chapter 3.1.1, this metric is far from the definitive measure of intelligence that it was once thought to be.

^(1) *The former name of the Keevia's home planet is Keierus. It was renamed Malorus because it was chosen as the capital planet of the Maloran Republic (-rus, pronounced "rez" is the suffix for planet in Keevian). For this reason, "Maloran" refers to something as being "from" or "of" the Maloran Republic, while "Keierian" refers to something as being "from" or "of" the planet of Malorus.*

^(2) *The other Keevia species are the Forest Keevia, which are larger and has leopard-like circular markings, and the Giant Keevia, which can grow to over a meter tall, certainly giant from the perspective of the Mountain , the smallest species in the genus.*

## External Anatomy

Keevia have a dense coat of golden brown fur, with lighter beige regions on their abdomen, tail, and the inside of their ears. This colouration is most likely for camouflage as their main colour is almost identical to that of Keierian sand. Other color variations exist, but the gold and beige colors are the most common.

As with most small intelligent life forms, the head of a Keevia is large in relation to their body, consistent with the minimum brain size theory as discussed in chapter 3.2.19. The mean diameter of a Keevia's head is 15 centimetres, and on their head are a pair of large equilateral triangular ears, a short and pointy muzzle ending in a black nose, cyan eyes, and the Keevia's most famous facial feature, four beige (the same colour as their countershading), pointed projections on their cheeks, two on each side. These are antennae that allow them to sense and transmit electromagnetic radiation, allowing them to be telepathic (see below).

Their bodies are thin and are slightly narrower than their head. They have thin legs that end in paws adapted for agility both in dry sand and for climbing on a wide variety of surfaces, including trees and rocks. Their paws also sport sets of extremely durable enamel coated retractable claws. They also have a short, wide tail, sometimes called a "puff", with the Keevia's signature golden brown fur from the base to the two thirds point, followed by a beige tip. This tail is mainly used for balance but also plays an important role in Keevian body language, and can be used to cover the face to keep warm.

## General Physiology

### Biochemistry

Keevia, like the majority of known life forms, are carbon-water based and are built on a biological framework based around genetic material and proteins. Consistent with our findings in chapter 2.5.10, Keevia and other keierian lifeforms are consistent with the convergent evolution theory of exobiochemistry, granting them a high degree of compatibility with most other known extraterrestrial biochemistries, the most practical aspects of this is that Keevia are capable of safely eating and digesting most types of alien foods.

### Blood and Lymphatics

Keevia blood is a bright cyan due to the presence of copper as part of their oxygen carrier cells. However, their muscles are red as they contain iron. This is the same as most other animals on the planet of Malorus. A Keevia can safely metabolize large amounts of both iron and copper^3, unlike most species. This is theorized to be the result of Malorus's relative abundance of both iron and copper.

In the Keevia's lymphatic system, along with immune cells, there are a large amount of "general stem cells", which are capable of differentiating into all types of tissue^(4), which allows a Keevia to efficiently repair damaged organs. This self repair mechanism is part of the reason Keevia can live to over two hundred Keierian years^(5).

^(3) *The clade of Keierian animals that use both iron and copper, including Keevia, split from the copper-only clades some 150 millions Keierian years ago.*

^(4) *General stem cells are different from Keevian fetal stem cells as they are not capable of forming any sort of embryonic structure that could grow into new individual. If they were fetal cells, it would mean that any Keevia would have a natural cloning mechanism that could be activated by extracting their general stem cells.*

^(5) *A Keierian year is one Earth year plus 67.29 Earth days.*

### Water Conservation

Malorus, being a desert planet, is expectedly extremely dry, and being a carbon-water based life form, Keevia have evolved to make the most out of the small amounts of water they can find. Metabolic processes have adapted to waste as little water as possible, and to recycle as much of the existing water in the body as possible. A Keevia's skin is impermeable to water, preventing loss by evaporation. They also produce very little urine compared to animals that are not adapted for such dry conditions.

Specialized cells form small water storage nodes throughout a Keevia's body, allowing them to drink large amounts of water whenever it is available, and store it for long periods of time when water may be difficult or impossible to acquire. An adult Keevia can survive up to 15 Keierian days without water.

### Thermoregulation

Keevia are capable of surviving in temperatures between 60 and -30 degrees celsius, which is an extreme temperature range but not unheard of in the Keierian deserts. Keevia are also known to have a great amount of physical strength and stamina, especially for their small size, which is a recipe for overheating during day time without special measures. To adapt to these conditions, they have evolved an impressive thermoregulation system.

Keevia don't sweat, nor do they pant to cool off. That would be too wasteful of precious water. Instead, their fur have the ability to modulate their thermal conductivity. When temperatures get too hot or cold, the fur turns into an insulator and shields their bodies from the thermal extremes (which is especially important if they are in direct sunlight), until temperatures become more mild, at which point the fur becomes thermally conductive to allow for the exchange of thermal energy.

If a Keevia's fur gets wet, the thermoconductivity of the affected hairs can get "stuck" at the most thermally conductive state until all of the water evaporates. Prolonged and untreated submersion of a Keevia's fur in water can damage the chemical pathway responsible for thermal regulation in each hair. For this reason, Keevia have a psychological stress response to contact with water. Both the stress response and the physiological effects it's meant to help avoid are rarely problems in their native environment, but can be points of concern for the modern Keevia living in a high-tech world, possibly on a planet where water is more abundant^(6).

As impressive as the chemistry is, the ability of a Keevia's fur to change thermal conductivity have been greatly exaggerated by many. A common myth is that their fur can change between the equivalent thermal conductivity of copper and polystyrene at will, but this isn't true. In reality, the thermal conductivity change is fairly small, and is used in conjunction with the next adaptation.

Keevia take advantage of the principles of chemical equilibrium to convert between thermal and chemical energy in order to balance their internal temperature. When the internal temperature gets too hot, thermalregulatory chemicals throughout their body use the excess energy to undergo a reaction into a higher-energy state, cooling the body and storing the energy. The reverse occurs when the body cools down too much. This process is regulated by hormones and other thermoregulatory chemicals. This allows a Keevia to store energy when it's too hot and release energy when it's too cold, and also be able to exchange that energy with their surroundings through their fur. During the hottest days, a Keevia's internal temperature can be significantly cooler than the ambient temperature.

^(6) *Pharmaceuticals designed to make Keevia both physiologically and mentally more tolerant of water are easily accessible in the Maloran Republic.*

### Diet and Digestion

Physiologically, Keevia are generalist omnivores who eat a wide range of animal and plant matter. The scarcity of food in their original habitat forced the Keevia to be capable of living on any type of food they could find and extracting as much nutrients from it as possible. Their bodies can can produce most nutrients they need either by directly synthesizing it or converting it from more generic biomolecules, in case they are unable to find food that contain them. As a result, Keevia require less variety in their diet than most omnivores, capable of being healthy while on a strict meat diet, a strict vegan diet, and most subsets in between. However, they do need relatively high amounts of both iron and copper while most other intelligent lifeforms require, sometimes significantly, more of one than the other.

Keevia have strong teeth that can be used for cracking open nuts and bones alike as well as tearing both plant and animal matter. The outer layers of their teeth regenerate in response to wear. Their dentition resembles that of most carnivores, meaning that though they are effective at tearing, they are less so at grinding tough vegetation. As a result, Keevia tend to eat by tearing up food into pieces just small enough for them to swallow them whole^(7).

A Keevia's gastrointestinal tract consists of the mouth, esophagus, stomach, upper small intestines, lower small intestines, and large intestines, in that order. The stomach enzymatically digests food the majority of the way and also act as a food cache, storing large amounts of surplus food without immediately digesting all of it in cases where the Keevia comes across a large amount of food but insufficient water, as water is required for the hydrolysis reactions involved in digestion. The upper small intestines has a wider diameter than the lower small intestines, and is responsible for completing digestion, while the lower small intestines is where the majority of absorption occurs, with no separation of locations where different nutrients are absorbed. The large intestines are also responsible for nutrient absorption, but more importantly for water absorption.

^(7) *This, along with most things mentioned in this chapter, describes what Keevia were originally adapted for. Modern Keevia tend to eat food that are less tough, and as a result, they are able to chew it more effectively.*

## Paws

Despite not having true hands, Keevias' front paws are quite dexterous and are capable of manipulating tools and objects extremely well. A Keevia's paws have exposed paw pads while most other species in the Equatorial Mountains have hooves or fur on the bottoms of their paws, as these provide a barrier between the potentially scorching sand. However, Keevias' paws have exposed pads for maximum dexterity and tactle information about the objects they touch. Their adaptation against the hot sand is simply to have the tissue of their paw pads heat resistant and insulative to protect the rest of the paw, with biomolecules specifically adapted to have a very high heat tolerance, combined with a much higher concentration of chemicals capable of endothermic reactions. Even so, the tissue has a high turnover rate in order to mitigate heat damage. They can still sense temperature reasonably precisely through their paws, but they can witstand very high temperatures before experiencing any pain or sustaining burn damage beyond acceptible levels.

## Sensory Adaptations

A Keevia's eyes have vertical elliptical pupils and are naturally resistant to the intense ambient light common in Keierian deserts, and is even capable of safely looking at the Keierian sun for small lengths of time. They are capable of detecting a wide range of light wavelengths. Their retinas contain five types of cone cells and can detect a continuous range from the standard water-transmissible wavelengths^(8) to the long to medium wavelength ultraviolet range. Their irises are always a bright cyan, the same colour as their blood. This is due to a network of capillaries along the surface of the iris, which feed nutrients and oxygen to an array of infrared sensors. Modified rod cells on the surface of the iris, with the help of lens cells on top of them, detect the far infrared radiation associated with heat, allowing the eyes to form a rough thermal map over-top of the main image generated by the retinas. This thermal map has very low spatial and thermal resolution and cannot be used to construct any fine detail, but allows a Keevia to determine the temperatures of objects in their field of vision, a useful adaptation for determining the temperature of an object without touching it and for detecting animals at night when they're beyond the range of their antennae.

The Keevia's large ears are also very sensitive, and can detect a large range of sound frequencies. The tufts of fur lining the inside of the ears deflect sand and debris and also reduce the noise created by wind blowing past the ear canals.

^(8) *These are the wavelengths humans can see.*

### Electromagnetic Sensing and Telepathy

Using the whisker antennae on their cheeks, Keevia can detect electromagnetic radiation. This allows them to detect the presence of other animals nearby based on the electrical currents generated by their neurons.

Keevia are one of the few intelligent species that are naturally capable of telepathy. They use their antennae to transmit and receive electromagnetic signals. Keevia are capable of telepathic empathy and conscious telepathic transmission. When two individuals are in range, they can choose to exchange some abstract ideas, which is most commonly used to augment spoken communication. It can help with explaining complex and/or abstract concepts or exchanging imagery, but it's not full mind reading as only what they intend to communicate is conveyed. Innate full mind reading abilities are exceedingly rare in known lifeforms.

Keevia are also very sensitive to emotions, even from those that are not telepathic themselves. For this reason, they are also described as empathic.

With effort and training, Keevia can enhance their telepathic abilities, including the detail of information transmitted and their effective range. With extreme effort and training, Keevia can achieve full mind reading where they can read other lifeforms' thoughts and mental states without the information being transmitted. However, this is an extremely rare practice due to the amount of effort required and because mind reading without explicit consent is illegal in the Maloran Republic and many other societies, and is seen by most as an extreme violation of privacy.

There is a slight sexual dichotomy where male Keevia have the lower two antennae shorter than the upper ones, while all four are the same length on females, as a staggered antenna morphology of males have been shown to be more effective for detecting the presence of other life forms, a useful trait in hunting and detecting intruders on one's territory, while the symmetric female morphology is more effective for telepathic communication by improving bi-directional signal integrity. This is consistent with the generally accepted theory that ancient Keevia lived in communes where males would be more likely to take on hunting, guarding and warrior roles whereas females tended to help coordinate the community.

Finally, an interesting fact about the Keevia's antennae is that they are comprised mostly of highly specialized nerve cells and nerve support cells, making Keevia one of the few species with exposed nerve tissue.

# Conclusion

Keevia are a very common species in the Maloran Republic, and their physiology is as interesting as they are common. The Keevia is just another example of the amazing complexity of life throughout the galaxy.

2020-11-15 10:35:44 : Post break up pain : AlexPalmyra : https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/jujzbq/post_break_up_pain/

My ex dumped me a month ago now and I am still struggling with the post break up pain. I am much better than I was a couple of weeks ago but I am still struggling to function with things such as work and finding any sort of happiness in my day. 

To give some background on the relationship, we are two men, late 20’s, and were seeing each other for several months in what was a fun relationship. We spent a lot of time together doing fun things like long walks in the park over the summer, cooking together, going out to eat and he would regularly stay at my place. We shared so many common interests and I felt happy that I seemed to have found someone beyond the usual gay hook ups that are common in a big city. 

Several months into the relationship I told him one night that I was falling in love with him. This was not a pre planned thing I was going to say and it just slipped out really as it was what I was feeling in that moment. He had been introduced to my best friend this night and he cooked for us and they got on really well together so I was just genuinely happy. The day after this he was being very off with me and since he went home that day I haven’t seen him again. 

I received a message two days later to say he didn’t want to see me anymore and I was a lovely guy but he can’t see it working, in this initial message I received no explanation so I responded to ask for one. When I received the explanation he basically unloaded on me that things were moving too fast and he felt like he was being ‘gaslighted’ into saying he loved me back, the misunderstanding of what gaslighting is and him accusing me of it was quite hurtful. He then went on to say he felt like I didn’t trust him as I asked him about a message on his phone from his dad, the reason for this being he was taking a trip with his dad and I wanted to know the dates so I could arrange to go on one with my family also, not once in the previous months of the relationship had I ever asked to see his phone. He then also stated things like he had a lot going on in his head and he was overwhelmed. 

I responded to everything he said explaining my intentions were genuine and he read the situation wrong. I have to this day not had a response to anything I said and was gradually blocked on all messaging platforms and social media over a space of two weeks rather than at once. A further blow was that he was back on a gay dating app two days after dumping me which has been hurtful as it seemed so fast to go from being introduced to your partners friend on a Friday to looking for new men on a Tuesday. 

I have analysed the situation so much and wanted to get some outside perspective to help me try and move on. I would like to point out that despite him saying things were moving to fast he had done the following:

- told family and friends about me 
- discussed going on holiday when travel restrictions are lifted 
- was very thoughtful for my birthday two weeks prior including writing in my card that he hopes this is the first birthday of many together 
- asked to be introduced to my friends 

All of the above gave me indicators that the relationship was moving at a good pace and my brain must have been giving me positive signals to tell him I was falling in love. 

Has anyone experienced anything similar or can offer any advice as this has really left me both heartbroken and confused as to where it all went wrong.

2020-11-15 10:35:43 : Help with final exam project? : nosespray4life : https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/jujzbn/help_with_final_exam_project/

Hi all, hope this is allowed here :-)

I am a multimedia design student from Denmark working on my final project. I need a bit of insight from some teachers in order to create the best possible solution, and am hoping there are some lovely teachers out here who can help!

I am mainly focusing on teachers who teach age 9-13 so if you are a teacher in that age group and have 2 minutes to fill out a little questionnaire it would be the biggest help!

[Link to questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdX01MHaboCW1u_QM5KZF-W1lJUtaJ5EQ55dbz_8CV93HjBEw/viewform?usp=sf_link)

A bit of background on the project: we are working on creating an interactive application which will educate kids about children's rights throughout history, and is intended to be used in supplement to normal lessons. It's of course just a student project, but we are in touch with a few different organisations who are interested in using parts of the final outcome - which is why we really want to include the voices of teachers.

Thank you!

Hi there! I already have a number of amazing pen pals. We often write rather long letters, which is awesome, but kinda limits the frequency a bit, since writing letters takes time. So I'm looking for someone interested in a more frequent exchange of snail mail. 

We could agree on a set time frame for replying (perhaps 10 days after receiving a letter), a maximum time we spend to write a letter, numbers of topics per letter or/and a page limit? Anything that helps us write each other often and get to know each other in a different way.

About me, the short version: 35 years old Danish female, living with my boyfriend, working with communication/marketing. Stuff I like: cycling, instax photography, meditation, yoga, drawing, journaling, tea drinking, watching sports on TV (or live when that's a thing...), just to mention some. 

We can discuss anything in our letters. I'm looking for long term friendships and at this point prefer female pen pals.

2020-11-15 10:36:21 : Unpopular opinion: C-SPAN rankings have some major problems : MichaelTheKing7 : https://www.reddit.com/r/Presidents/comments/jujzit/unpopular_opinion_cspan_rankings_have_some_major/

I personally think that C-SPAN rankings are pretty bad and kind of overrated. There are a lot of problems with the rankings such as their criteria,recency bias and historical overlooking. I will look into all of their rankings and criteria to really showcase the problems with C-SPAN and why they shouldn't be looked upon as much as they are. Let's start off with the biggest problem:

**CRITERIA**

C-SPAN uses 10 criteria to rate the presidents,out of a 100 for every category which makes the total score out of a 1000. This already leaves us with an issue. Having this much criteria can lead to some really unnecessary categories,for example: Administrative skills (this has nothing to do with the president's record and also dosen't really make sense. What counts as a bad administrative skill?), Crisis Leadership (this can only really go with about 1/3 of the presidents as most presidents didn't lead during a crisis. We need a exact definition of a crisis from C-SPAN and even there,there will definitely still be about 4-3 presidents that didn't lead during a had time in history) and Performance within context of times (isn't that the whole goal of this ranking? Why make an entire category about something that is the main goal you are trying to reach?). Another main problem is the fact they are rated out of a 100 in each category. I get they want a big number for the overall score,but it isn't needed. This just makes it feel like they are throwing random numbers at presidents with not that much thought. Why does James Polk get a 53.2 on Moral Authority? Why does Warren Harding get a 40.6 on Economic management? This feels like random number thrown with little thought put into it.

**BIAS**

It is clear that C-SPAN favors democratic presidents, especially considering that most of the voters are democratic. Lets take a look at the most recent ranking:

Here are president's George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Despite being very similar in foreign policy and also quite similar in economic policy, they have 21 presidents in between them which is absurd. Bush got penalized for his relations in the middle east,but no praise for his great relations in Africa. Obama meanwhile got loads of praise just for the fact he ended the war in Iraq and didn't get knocked for his bombing of Pakistan and involvement in Syria.

|President|Rank|Difference|
|:-|:-|:-|
|George W. Bush  **(R)** |12|21 spots|
|Barack Obama  **(D)** |33|21 spots|

Here are presidents Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Herbert Hoover. Despite both failing to help the country during the Great Depression, FDR is ranked fifth best in ,,Economic management'' and Hoover is dead last. FDR also ranks at the top in ,,International relations'' even though he signed the Japanese,Asian,Italian and German Interment camps and tried to hide all the evil things the Soviet Union was doing. Meanwhile,Hoover is ranked 31st despite ending 2 interventions that were started all the way back in the Taft administration and also admonished Japan.

&amp;#x200B;

|President|Economic Management|International Relations|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Herbert Hoover|43|31|
|FDR|5|1|
|Difference|38 spots|30 spots|

They also did Trump only after 2 years (which isn't enough at all to rate a president) and he ranked dead last, below the damn president who ignored a Civil war. This is just pandering and clear that they don't like Republican presidents. Other examples are Eisenhower and Reagan who got very low ratings when they initially left office however when their achievements became more public, they got higher rankings most likely because C-SPAN didn't want to get criticized.

**HISTORICAL MISTAKES AND OVERLOOKING**

C-SPAN is also pretty inconsistent as they flat out ignore some things that would rate a president they like lower. For example, Harding gets a lot of flack for his love affairs but JFK,LBJ,FDR,Wilson,Cleveland and Clinton don't get any critique whatsoever. Franklin Pierce landed as the 3rd worst president in ,,Economic management'' despite lowering tariffs and the national debt by a whooping 83%. Taylor ranked 30th in ,,International relations despite preventing Venezuela from fillerbusting Cuba and improving relations with Britain. LBJ ranked 1st in ,,Relations with Congress'' despite his Johnson treatment.

**VERDICT**

I think the idea of C-SPAN's rankings is great,but the execution is poor and there are a lot of historical mistakes and clear bias.

In my first post I asked about my exemption being 3 days short (87 days) of the 3 month (90 days) due to a miscommunication with my travel agent. 
I have since realised that I would actually return on day 89.
I need advice on what to do about this as now I can’t find any other flights to book to return home before my ESTA visa runs out on day 90.
Perhaps a detour flight first to gain one full day and if so where would be the cheapest?

A noiseless patient spider,

Mark’d how to explore the vacant vast surrounding, 
It launch’d forth filament, filament, filament, out of        itself, 
Ever unreeling them, ever tirelessly speeding them. 

And you O my soul where you stand, 
Surrounded, detached, in measureless oceans of space, 
Ceaselessly musing, venturing, throwing, seeking the spheres to connect them, 
Till the bridge you will need be form’d, till the ductile anchor hold, 
Till the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere, O my soul.

Edit = Formatting

Hi, using a Pi Zero as Pihole and Speed Test (using speedtest-cli). The PiZero is hardwired via ethernet directly to my router using [this 3rd party USB ––&gt; Ethernet dongle](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/three-port-usb-hub-with-ethernet-and-microb-connector) (rated to \~12MB/s)

2020-11-15 10:37:15 : Who is Guizhong, and her relation to 1.1 : tzitzimeme : https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/jujzte/who_is_guizhong_and_her_relation_to_11/

Foreword: a lot of this information has already been compiled by Chinese players, and in particular I cross-referenced my research frequently with [this post on nga.cn](https://ngabbs.com/read.php?tid=23939831); this wouldn’t have been possible without the tireless work of others as well!

Obvious spoiler warning ahead, especially for 1.1 content below! With that, let’s get into what we know:

**1. The Basics about Guizhong**

A lot of people first see mention of Guizhong by the Guizhong Ballista which she created (and we fixed) in the story, which was later used to defeat Osial. But mentions of her actually appear even earlier than that.

[In Custodian of Clouds](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Custodian_of_Clouds) AKA the quest where you cook food to summon the Cloud Retainer, the table seats three people: Cloud Retainer, Rex Lapis and Guizhong. From this, it’s clear she’s friend with Rex Lapis and other adepti.

The biggest loredump comes from the [Treasure Lost, Treasure Found](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Treasure_Lost,_Treasure_Found) world quest, which is the one in Guili Plains where you have to beat up a bunch of Ruin Guards and find stone tablets to compile information for the scholar, Soraya. From these tablets, you learn that:

Guizhong was the Goddess of Dust, and a kind-hearted gentle deity She protected the people of Guili along with another god whose dominion was over Geo (Rex Lapis) Guili Assembly was named after the combination of their two names (most likely, Gui from Guizhong + li from Zhongli) Whatever was once Guili Assembly is now nothing but ruins.

A further explanation is provided in the [Stone Tablet Compilations (I)](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Stone_Tablet_Compilations_(I)). Particularly: “It later came to pass that the gods each strove for dominance, which brought catastrophe upon the land. Though the adepti fought to protect the Guili Plains, they could not stop the tide of war, which ravaged the plains and took the life of its ruler, Guizhong. Thereupon, the Lord of Rock Rex Lapis took his people south of Mt. Tianheng. Thus the people departed from the Guili Plains for good, never to return, and it was left to become a wilderness.”

When the ‘gods each strove for dominance’, this is referring to the [Archon War](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Archon_War) that swept across Teyvat over 2000 years before the current game’s plotline. There’s a lot of cool lore concerning Venti and Andrius’ involvement in the war concerning Mondstadt, but for now, what you need to know is that Guizhong was one of the Archon War’s many casualties. After which, Rex Lapis took the people of Liyue south, AKA where Liyue Harbor is now.

**2. Debunking the ‘is Guizhong actually Madame Ping/is Guizhong actually Salt Goddess’ theories**

Just to get this out of the way, Guizhong is almost definitely not Madame Ping as some people have speculated. Firstly because Guizhong is very dead and Madame Ping is old, yes, but still alive. However, the Cleansing Bell you get from Madame Ping is interesting, but we will expand on that later.

Secondly, around Sal Terrae and the [Customs of Liyue Vol 1](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Customs_of_Liyue), you may have noticed mentions of a Salt Goddess who is buried there, likely in that weird inaccessible area with the blue glowey thing stopping us from entering. This is probably not the same person as Guizhong, as [the Diary of Roald the Adventurer](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Diary_of_Roald_the_Adventurer) mentions that the Salt Goddess’ people settled in Sal Terrae where her body now lies, NOT the Guili Plains as Guizhong &amp; Zhongli are credited towards.

**3. Speculatory Territory: How exactly did Guizhong die?**

So we’ve established that Guizhong’s life ended during the Archon War. One would assume that, being a war and all, she was likely killed by someone trying to control Liyue. But things get a little more interesting than that. *Warning: some mention of translated leaked Chinese lines from currently unreleased characters incoming!*

Theory 1: **Guizhong was killed by the Chi of Guyun/Osial/some other monster**

Pretty clear-cut: Guizhong was killed by one of the many terrifying beasts Liyue had to face. The [Chi of Guyun](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/The_Chi_of_Guyun) world quest expands on how Rex Lapis killed it, and it’s possible Guizhong may have also been a casualty in the struggle, but other than that there’s not much evidence.

As for Osial, a leaked line from Zhongli reveals that he doesn’t like seafood because they bring back bad memories (我不喜欢海鲜。仅仅是看到海鲜，就会想到那种...该怎么说呢，滑溜溜的触感，洗不净的腥味。哦，原因的话... 唉，说来话长，就当是应为我的记性太好了吧。= I do not enjoy seafood. When I see seafood, I think about... how do I say... the slimy texture, the feeling of being unable to clean oneself. Oh, the reason why... ah, I’ve been rambling, let’s just say that my memory is too good). Coupled with how Xiao states he’s ‘very familiar’ with Osial’s attack, it’s not too much a stretch to imagine that their first conflict was probably pretty terrible. Possibly terrible enough to turn Zhongli off seafood after thousands of years and kill Guizhong.

This is supported by Soraya’s musings: “But it was the gentle gods who were ultimately powerless to protect their people. Look at Guizhong — it took an elaborate treasure hunt just to preserve the four commandments that were once the lifeblood of a whole civilization.” Despite the intricacy of her inventions, especially the ballista, Guizhong herself simply wasn’t strong enough and was killed.

Theory 2: **Zhongli killed Guizhong because she became corrupted**

The [Circlet of Logos](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Archaic_Petra) in the Archaic Petra set has lore which states: “He knew right from wrong, and never missed his mark: in those days of tumult, he would show no mercy, even to friends-turned-foes.”

That specific remark about ‘friends-turned-foes’ is interesting. As seen in the Treasure Lost, Treasure Found quest, Soraya reads: "...and there they fought upon the Guili Plains, where **black dust** choked the heavens and a **thousand rocks splintered**..." Black dust from a corrupted Guizhong, and rocks splintering being associated with Zhongli = Guizhong and Zhongli fought, and it is their battle which destroyed Guili Assembly?

Of course, this brings into question how she possibly got corrupted in the first place. Admittedly, I couldn’t find much information on that front, but (pure speculation) the [Cleansing Bell](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/The_Realm_Within) you get from Madame Ping is actually called 涤尘铃 in Chinese, which more specifically means “Dust-Washing Bell”. The 尘 symbol is exactly the same as the one used in Guizhong’s title as Goddess of Dust (尘神归终). Perhaps they had tried to cleanse her with that bell, but ultimately failed? Afterwhich, Zhongli wore it on his person and eventually gave it to Madame Ping.

Also, while Zhongli rambled on and on about the Silk Flower perfumes and other customs surrounding the Rite of Parting, he said nothing about the Cleansing Bell. What part did it had to do with the rite? Well, maybe it had... nothing to do with the rite. He just wanted a memento of an old friend back before he fucked off into retirement.

Theory 3: **Adeptus Xiao killed Guizhong**

In his leaked Chinese lines, Xiao states "别被污染，我不会留情的" = “Don't be corrupted, I won't show mercy.” And another: “如果有一天，连你也陷入黑暗。就由我来—” = “If there comes a day where even you fall into darkness, then I--” (implying “I won’t hesitate bitch” and kill you)

These voicelines imply he’s had to do this before, perhaps to Guizhong? Or perhaps he is referring to the other yakshas, [as one of the CBT lorebooks imply](https://www.gensh.in/database/book/yakshas-the-vigilant-adepti) that some of the yakshas went insane because of the violent nature of their duties.

(Fun fact: Xiao is Alatus and the only surviving yaksha, who are a special class of adepti specifically tasked with defeating the demons that rise from [the undying grudges of old gods defeated during the Archon War](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Lustrous_Stone_from_Guyun). All his friends are dead. [The Yaksha’s Wish](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/The_Yaksha%27s_Wish) world quest implies Bosacius, one of the five strongest along with Xiao and the only other to survive till peacetime, took his own life.)

It’s very possible both of these are true, where Zhongli and Xiao had to kill her together to save their people.

**4. Speculative Territory: The nature of Zhongli and Guizhong’s relationship in explaining Zhongli’s 1.1 actions**

A new weapon, aptly named [Memory of Dust](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Memory_of_Dust), contains a snippet of Zhongli &amp; Guizhong’s first meeting-- and final parting. In particular, that they met when the Glaze Lilies were in full bloom, and how she was the brains and he was the brawns. Therein lies an implication that amongst the two, Guizhong was the ‘human’ one, the gentle goddess who was empathetic towards the fears of humanity, while Zhongli just stabbed things and summoned meteors. Such a cruel, emotionless god is a jarring image to place onto our beloved dastardly himbo, but other lore tidbits support this:

Venti calls Zhongli a “brutish blundering buffoon” and “old block-head” in his voicelines. But in Chinese, he specifically insults Zhongli with 不懂人心的死脑筋 = “A dead brain who cannot understand human feelings”.

Let’s look back at the Circlet of Logos lore too: “It is said that during the years when gods contended against one another, Rex Lapis' aspect was that of boundless slaughter. In those god-eat-god battles, one could never have ascribed gentleness to him... \[...\] Rex Lapis' stone-cold expression never once changed throughout that storied age. They say that only when the dust settled did he lay down that unmovable visage. But it had been necessary, for he had donned it to fulfill a contract.”

From all this, we can see that Zhongli obviously struggles to understand human emotions. In the past, he led Liyue as a God of War. In current times, such wartime prowess is unneeded, so he is basically left as just the weirdest human ever (as he basically bumbled through Liyue with 0 social awareness or understanding of Mora, despite it, literally, being his namesake-- he has simply been revered for so long he is insanely out of touch with normal day-to-day human actions). But what if Zhongli is *aware* of this gap? What if he realizes, intimately, that he is incapable of relating to the humans he is meant to lead? What if his inability to ever unlock the Memory of Dust which Guizhong left him, still haunts him?

Many were confused at Zhongli basically just giving his Gnosis up and roleplaying as a human (and potentially sending Teyvat into a ruinous financial crisis in the process as they will now be unable to produce Mora, oops?). From what Zhongli said about ‘finishing his duty’, many assumed he was just tired of being in charge and this is his way of turning in his resignation before an eternity-long retirement.

But in Zhongli’s Chinese voicelines, he makes many nostalgic mentions to an old friend who is heavily implied to be Guizhong. Furthermore, remember that Rex Lapis likes perfume associated with mature women: a reference to Guizhong? Let's not forget how Zhongli got pretty mad at the Treasure Hoarders who damaged the Guizhong Ballista as well. [The maintenance notice for the ballista is also... aggressive.](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Guizhong_Ballista)

All of this lends credence to how Zhongli still misses her, still lingers on her words, and perhaps, still wants to accomplish her challenge to him: to unlock the Memory of Dust. To understand humanity. Perhaps he lets go of his duties, not just to fuck off and have fun (ala Venti), but because he finally realizes Liyue can stand on its own two feet and now he can pursue a personal goal he has put aside for over two millennia: to be human.

Unfortunately, to that end, he retires by basically sitting aside sipping a pina colada while Liyue nearly gets swallowed by an old sea god, likely giving everyone in Liyue PTSD, but he wouldn’t be Zhongli if he didn’t go out doing something catastrophically out of touch.

**5. Additional Trivia**

1. Guizhong seems to be quite the respected tinkerer, as Cloud Retainer was very proud of the fact that both Guizhong and Rex Lapis praised her creations. (**Cloud Retainer:** In fact, even Guizhong and Rex Lapis themselves found one's technological accomplishments to be worthy of commendation.)
2. It’s possible the person who designed the Guili Assembly riddle was actually Zhongli. It is, after all, incredibly detailed despite most people forgetting Guizhong ever existed.

**Soraya:** How fascinating. In all the documents I've ever read, I've never come across any mention of two gods who coexisted peacefully... let alone who actively worked together...

**Soraya:** It seems they were more than two allied gods — they were best friends.

\[...\]

**Soraya:** Whoever designed this riddle must have truly revered Guizhong.

**Soraya:** So much so that they preserved Guizhong's Four Commandments for future generations, even though the Guili Assembly was wiped out.

3. Maybe Zhongli left the Glaze Lilies to the last task because he knew it would bring back painful memories of Guizhong. (pain)

That’s all I’ve got, folks! Do tell me if I missed anything out and I hope this piqued your interest in the lore of this game, because it runs REALLY DEEP. If you enjoy Liyue lore and wanna talk further, you can ~~read my fanfiction~~ catch me on twitter, same name as my reddit account ~~where I do nothing but ship Xiao/Zhongli all day so maybe you shouldn't.~~

i hope this is the correct subreddit for this...

i've spent the last three hours looking at apps in app store searching a basic and simple budgeting / expense tracking app. I've found nothing. Either the app is way too complicated or it looks like it was made back in 1990.

does anyone of you know an app where I can set multiple recurring budgets (e.g. monthly) and just add expenses to these budgets whenever you spend something?

if not, what app are you using and how are you using it?

I can disable particles if i dont want to see them. And scalps will duplicate vertices increasing polycount. If I don't retopo this gets even worse. What am i missing?

I am hoping to change careers to IT at the moment and was wondering what the easiest way in is... if I pass the A+ with a good score will it qualify or guarantee me a job in IT and does getting raises often include how many more certifications you go on to get?

My end goal is cloud Engineering like AWS. How many years do you think it would take to get there? Is there a roadmap or is it like picking and choosing certificates to be qualified for a higher pay? Can I get an entry level job the study the next level of certification and then “level up” (essentially) the job ladder?

Writing college essays right now and I feel like it's so hypocritical for colleges to advertise about their rankings through admission emails and on their website then tell students to not talk about their rankings in their "Why Us" essay. Obviously, there's usually something about the campus, the curriculum, or even the location that made this my dream school but ranking still plays a part.

2020-11-15 10:39:07 : Pain : jxc_f : https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/juk0e2/pain/

I’m (18M) and there is this one girl who I had a massive crush on about 4 years back. We were best friends at the time and she knew of my feelings but rejected me. We remained friends for a few more years but eventually grew distant because of arguments and other complications. It took a long time for me to get over her. I don’t talk to her now and rarely think of her at all so I thought I was over her. But I was looking through some old photos on my cloud drive today (which were autosaved from messages from my old phone) and came across some pictures of her. I couldn’t help but admire her beauty and it made me recollect all the painful memories of rejection and struggle to get over her throughout the years prior.

She was my first real crush and the first person I truly cared about that way. As much as I want and believe that I’ve gotten over her, things like this make me questions myself. I have also realised that it’s hard for me to crush on anyone nowadays because I think I’m afraid of going through something similar all over again. What should I do moving forward?

And just to clarify, during the process of getting over her I removed her from all aspects of my life (ie. on social media) and have even met a whole bunch of new people when I moved to college.

2020-11-15 10:38:57 : About the duplicates.. : fuenfsiebenneun : https://www.reddit.com/r/HPPuzzlesAndSpells/comments/juk0cc/about_the_duplicates/

So as you probably know, you collect duplicates up to 50 and exchange those for a „unique card“ (e.g. one you don‘t own yet) and i think thats fine. 
The problem I have is that this unique card always seems to be the least rare one that‘s available for you, for example if you’re still missing a common card from any album, the unique card will be this common card, if it‘s a rare card it’s gonna be this one and so on. 
Now obviously you always want your 50 duplicate card to be a legendary one since you won‘t get those very often. 

But now that there‘s a new Album out with brand new cards, I‘m again missing some common and some rare ones and don‘t want to open my unique card to see a common one, that‘s why I‘m waiting until i again have all of them but the legendary cards. 

My question is: Is it worth it though? Do I still collect duplicates while having a duplicate card unopened? I know it works with regular cards but here I‘m not sure. What‘s the smartest thing to do here? I‘d greatly appreciate any advice :)

I saw a lot of posts in here r/unpopularopinion about assuming different disabled people using their disability for the shitty behavior, but from my observartions they're way less likely to be bad people, most likely because of "disabilty isn't excuse for being bad"ers.

For example I live in a middle eastern country with average IQ of 89s so a lot of shitty behaviors (sexual assault, fighting, bad pranks for example and I'm talking about adults here) are normalized here. But when it comes to disabled people are chastising them for almost anything.

I'm in my late teens, had to fight for being included in the education system (I'm not in school for more than a year, will go back next year), was always altruistic and an excellent student but kind of rebellious, do my best to manage my symptoms, have goals (being a trillionare, getting a full time job as a programmer, getting a master's), have a profession despite being a teenager, and was an ex chess prodigy (I haven't played more than a decade and still maintain a 300 elo). But even still, I heard the phrase "stop using your disability as a cover for your shitty behavior" for millions of times, both online and IRL.

I don't owe ableds a pair goody-two-shoes.

Hi everyone,

To improve in the game and eventually participate in warzone tournaments me and a mate are looking for two players to build a consistent squad. We are both Dutch, 25-26 yrs old and have been focussing on improving our game for a while now. I play on PC and my mate plays on the PS4 (with a scuffed controller + monitor). Our weekly KD is around 2-2.5 right now. 

What are we looking for?  
\- 18+  
\- Preferably Dutch because of easier communication, but we are willing to switch to English as well.   
\- Decent mic + clear communication  
\- Have the same goals as us in terms of improving and eventually participate in a tournament.   
\- Around the same KD as us. We prefer good communication over KD, but gunskill is an important factor of winning games.   


Having fun together is one of the main goals as well. We are not pro and still make loads of mistakes, so don't expect a winning squad right away. It takes time to get to know each others play style and improve as a squad. 

Thanks for reading and send me a msg on reddit if you are interested!

2020-11-15 10:39:56 : go for it : scorpiogirlx13 : https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_story/comments/juk0o7/go_for_it/

Well this isnt the story that i wanted to start off with, but since i cant seem to finish a story without somehow adding parts of it in i figured telling the whole thing first might be helpful to those who read anything i post.

My life hasnt been easy, because of my own doing. My parents provided my younger brother (by 2yrs and some months) and i with everything we needed and then some. I started riding horses when i was 5, got my own horse for my 10th birthday as a surprise-which surprise was ruined by a friend story for another time though. My brother and I grew up unlike most siblings, we were best friends. Just about everything we did, we did together. Hell we even had the same pretty giant group of friends-our huge family. I was friends with the older brother or sister in my grade or above, him friends with the younger sibling. We were all friends though, always all of us together. I grew up not your average girl, i rode horses, had quads, go-carts, was out with the guys watching them skateboard, playing paintball, needless to say i didnt have very many girlfriends. i had a few over the years the very few girls i called my best friends, but it always ended the same the closest i ever was to another person was my younger brother. We told each other everything, we got introuble together, we covered for each other, hes been arrested while screaming at me to shut the fuck up and sit down bc im 18 now hes got this one, we went out partying together, we threw the party. Until he got older and the roles switched i was his protector, from our alcoholic mom  who got violent when she drank, but sober was pretty great, our dad was just awesome. Our parents always got along with our friends they always wanted to feed everyone and they did jsut that our friends would come over for the home cooked meal and a beer and be happy with not even seeing us if it came down to it. We had our ups and downs as a family but always our thing was to stick together, theres nothing stronger than family, they are the ones who will be there for you when the smoke clears, the dust settles, family will always be by your side. My mom and i though we never really saw eye to eye her and my brother were a bit closer than her and i, my dad and i though we were very close. Guy trouble? went to my dad and brother, found out i was pregnant some years back called my little brother and had him tell my mom for me, mind you i was states away and still had him tell her. I could go on for days how much i love my dad and my brother the warm feeling i got when waking into my house and my dad / brother would look up from the tv/theirbook/video game and greet me with a huge smile every time and say their own personal greeting i got everytime from them.   


Well little over a year and half ago now they both passed...my brother in my arms and my dad exactly to the day 4 months later...since then my best friend of 10yrs we got into a fight havent really talked since..every other one of my friends except e friend who was also my brothers best friend has also left my life..my 3 cats have died, and now in 2 days our home is being sold. My mom is drinking herself to death and doesnt want me around. So yeah i feel pretty out of place in the world. How broken can someone be before the pieces cant be picked up and put back together again? I cant make it through a day without crying a few times like i am currently. i havent talked about any of this in a while now i found other ways of "coping" that arent the best and i know they arent and there shouldnt be a "but" to follow that sentence only there is...but my "coping" method causes me to not have to think about how alone i feel, the fact they are gone from mine and my sons life forever, before he really got to even know them, and they loved him so much. if i ever got married one day-which i dont see being in the cards for me-they wont be there, no one to walk me, no one to get drunk with me before and after and say "wtf did you just do i cant believe you just got married" my brother was suppose to be apart of almost every part of my life, and mine his. He had a gf of 7 years too, for fun one night they had me plan their wedding bc i said i wanted to party plan so they said okay give it a shot you know us how would we want our wedding. i nailed it they loved it, hell they were going to use some of my ideas. 

They were suppose to be here for many years to come still, and now where i use to have this warm happy feeling, love for someone else and knowing i was loved in returned, trust like no other, honesty, support, everything good, has been replaced with this empty dark nothingness that seems to go on forever that is somehow empty yet filled with sadness, anger at the world for letting this happen, for taking them from me, for letting them suffer the way they did, for the false hope it gave my mom and i during our time of losing them, and then again for just taking them in general, and then it circles back around to sadness and confusion of why?  
i dont know what i did exactly in life to have this happen, ive done my fair share of fucked up shit, bad choices, i could have lived a differnet life but i didnt think any of it measured up to losing everything ive ever loved and known in under 2 years. i havent processed one thing yet before the next thing crashes into my life.

i am now living with my only friend who literally hasnt left my side since this happened. he lived with me at my house bc i cant be alone, i couldnt be in my room alone since thats where my brother left us, my mom and i fight terribly, she told me to get out im selling the house figure it out so he let me come here even tho i drive him nuts bc i am a moody bitchy lately bc idk how im feeling from one second to the next and every other minute im crying, so yeah i feel bad for him. 

i didnt want to start with such a down and sad story but if i didnt get some of it off my chest i was going to explode i think i still might bc WHAT THE FUCK!!!!! i dont understand wtf happened!? so fucked. if i dont just post it now i wont so yeah, here it goes. any spelling errors and all that sorry typing quickly to get it out before i chicken out.

hey guys!

I realized I don't really know how exponents and Logs work in equations. I know how to add,multiply,divide equations but I still have doubts with how exactly you can manipulate equations using exponents.

For example; In Pythagorean theorem, a^2 + b^2 = c^2. I always wondered why you cant just root everything and get a+b=c. Then i thought, Okay first you need to solve inside the brackets then square root. 

After that I thought that you cant actually just magically change the exponents. x^3+x^4=x^5 , you would have to divide all sides by 1^3 (so you actually do multiplication to change the exponent). But then i realised even thats wrong.

Is there anywhere I could read and learn how exponents and logs work in equations? Thank you guys so much (I hated math all my life and sucked at it this is my first attempt to learn :) )

2020-11-15 10:40:47 : I have an interesting theory about Jason's hallucinations in Season 5 (Spoilers) : trapped585 : https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueBlood/comments/juk0zb/i_have_an_interesting_theory_about_jasons/

So I know in the season 5 finale after Jason's gets hit by the faerie light, he starts having hallucinations of his dead parents who express a lot of anti-vampire sentiments, and even start encouraging this behavior in Jason. When I first saw this, I assumed this was just a combination of Jason's head injury, the side effects of the faerie light, and his growing anger towards vampires (which had been building up for most of the season), and that his parents were just hallucinations.

However, we find out later in season 6 that Sookie and Jason's parents tried to drown Sookie as a kid when they found out that Warlow (a faerie-vampire) was coming to collect their daughter. Even in season 6, Sookie's dad tries it again when he possesses Lafayette and kidnaps Sookie to kill her.

At the time, I was confused by the motivations of the Stackhouse parents, and thought it didn't make any sense. 

But then I remembered Antonia's arc in season 4: One of the things she mentioned is that after being burned at the stake, she spent 400 years trapped in the afterlife unable to move on and nearly driven to insanity by her hatred of vampires.

What if the same thing happened to the Stackhouse parents? What if they have spent years trapped in the afterlife, unable to move on, and their fear/hatred of vampires magnified to an intense extent?

What if the hallucinations that Jason saw in season 5 weren't hallucinations, but were actually the spirits of his parents egging him on? What if the faerie light that Jason got hit with allowed him to communicate with his deceased parents temporarily?

Like I said, it's just a theory I have. Let me know what you think in the comment section!

2020-11-15 10:41:01 : How to fix the Controller Disconnect Bug for CoD: Cold War PS4 : Epicfunny98 : https://www.reddit.com/r/blackopscoldwar/comments/juk126/how_to_fix_the_controller_disconnect_bug_for_cod/

If you're in a middle of a game and the controller blinking white or your in the menu when it's blinking white, First restart your PS4 and it'll work again once it is back on. Next go to your settings and go to Devices. Go to Controllers then head to Communication Method and select Use USB Cable, this will make you play with your controller while connecting to USB. Yes it'll suck playing without it being wireless but this is the only solution that there is, hopefully this'll be patch soon but we can never know. If you got any questions please comment down below.

2020-11-15 10:41:23 : An Educational Game: Tribe : Valianttheywere : https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingPrompts/comments/juk16w/an_educational_game_tribe/

The Gameboard. We have Africa divided into assorted zones along with three possible start points.


So the game is for 2-3 players.

Each player gets a language development card deck.





Game play: each player rolls 1d6. This is the number of starting cards you can draw from your language development deck. 



The name of your tribe is made from this initial alphabet.



Your first game piece is on the start point.



What happens during a turn?

step 1: Turn Option

A. Move an existing piece to an adjacent location.

or

B. Attack a rival on an adjacent location. This is a massacre and you take the location from your rival.

Or

C. Spawn a new piece from your start location-only if you have an existing piece on start location. The new piece is moved into an empty adjacent location.

Or

D. develop language. Roll 1d6. Draw new alphabet cards from your language deck equal in number.

 

Step 2: Check language Development. If you can spell a word from your drawn alphabet- words like farming, pyramid, canoe, boat, then your tribe has developed these. If you can spell canoe and have secured a location next to madagascar, you can move a game piece to the island next turn. If you can spell boat you can sail from any coastal location to madagascar next turn.

As your tribe occupies the map, in conflict with your opponent(s) the game continues until you gain all 26 letters of the alphabet before your rival.



Its just a little educational game I created for public domain as an outflow of my linguistic archaeology research. So feel free to turn it into a billion dollar online franchise.

2020-11-15 10:41:32 : TIFU by posting a video of me making my penis longer to my Instagram story. : Teehamic : https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/juk18k/tifu_by_posting_a_video_of_me_making_my_penis/

Ok, this happened 5 minutes ago while I (19m) was in the bathroom. I was sitting, doing my business when I came across a video of someone recording their cat with some sort of filter, kind of hard to explain, but it basically scans the screen slowly and the end result is usually funny. So I got the idea to take a video of my penis, and the part where it would be around the middle, I would make the filter stretch it just to see what it would look like. Well, I started recording, and I did the thing, and it did look pretty funny. But around 2 mins ago I got a DM from my close friend telling me that I posted it to my story and my 500 followers. I hurried and went to the story, and 67 people (i think that was the number) had already seen it... Apparently I haven't posted in a while so it notified all of my followers about this. Anyways, thought that was funny enough to share and maybe even prevent someone from doing the same.

TLDR, I uploaded a video of me making my penis seem longer to Instagram and showed around 70 of my followers.

2020-11-15 10:41:30 : Ex called cops over my yelling and risked getting my family deported : hewellldig : https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/juk184/ex_called_cops_over_my_yelling_and_risked_getting/

We were together for four years.

This was my first time staying overnight at ex's since pandemic and starting treatment/therapy. He ignored me all day and didn't offer food so he could play his PS5. I literally had no TV or computer to use. Just sat on my phone all day. I'm (24F on DACA) diagnosed with anxiety and I was feeling ignored and overwhelmed about going to a bar that night so I tell him I want to go home, in tears.

Ex (23M) raises his voice and berates me, saying I should just stay home for the rest of my life if I can't even handle one weekend.

I get furious that he would say that to me while I was crying so I yell back at him.

His new roommate was outside so my ex told me to shut up or take "my crazy ass" outside. I couldn't because I had no car and I lived an hour away, he was my only ride, and I have literally no money to spend $200 on an uber home.

So I got even more angry and yell even louder because he would 1) Not address that he instigated the reaction when I wasn't even angry at him before 2) He would threaten to just dump me outside without a way home.

Then he says he's going to call the cops if I don't leave his house. This crosses the line because he knows I'm on DACA and my parents are undocumented. Bringing in the police means risking my DACA status or my parents getting deported.

He has never said this before but he tends to say a lot of bluffs, so I'm even more angry that he would cross the line and threaten me with ruining my family's lives (after all they have done for him). I get even LOUDER and tell him if he's going to cross the line by saying it he might as well do it (I was trying to catch another bluff).

He proceeds to call the police. He hangs up mid-call, just to show he did it. They call him back, he says nevermind. The fact that he called them AT ALL set me off so I yelled in the background that I was still there. The police come, no crime was committed, and he apologizes to them for wasting their time.

He proceeds to blame me for making him call the police. We broke up. Yet somehow I miss this guy??? I need a pep talk to snap me out of this toxic relationship.

TL;DR:  I have diagnosed anxiety. I wanted to go home. Boyfriend berates me. I get angrier. Escalates so he calls the police on me even though no crime was committed, risking me and my family's safety.

2020-11-15 10:41:23 : Guides and tips to weight loss? : starrynightbabe : https://www.reddit.com/r/Vindicta/comments/juk170/guides_and_tips_to_weight_loss/

Hey girls!! I'm new to Vindicta and I made a new account on reddit dedicated to my glowing up journey. Healthmaxx is my first step. I hope to make more posts, as I get further along in my journey.

I'm currently in a rut due to Covid. I don't feel comfortable in my body after I gained some weight in the last two years. I don't feel confident wearing my clothes. My old clothes don't fit well anymore, and that made me purchase clothes in larger sizes until I can lose some pounds.

I think weight gain is a topic that's not spoken about openly. Our bodies change as we mature and have more responsibilities. I never spoke about this with others, but since I have to take care of my family, I felt I needed to have a robust body to get everything done. Now I feel like a physical mess (on the chubbier side), and I'd like to get fit again.

My goal is to lose 20 - 25 pounds.

Do you guys have any exercises/tips to get a flat stomach, sides, arms, and thighs?

2020-11-15 10:42:18 : Being a Cat Lady is not normal : alison00hendrix : https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/juk1h1/being_a_cat_lady_is_not_normal/

The cat lady trope has been something over played in the media and now in real life too often. I'm sick of seeing a bunch of cat ladies with 5+ cats taking pictures on Instagram walking the cats on a leash and feeding them veg like that shit is normal. Yes women are Great but owning 15 cats is not a normal thing. Perhaps you don't want kids perhaps you we like cats either way I'm done with having to accept cat ladies as functioning sound minded people of the world. Do not get it twisted we all have our vices but owning multiple cats is still weird and shouod be seen as so.

2020-11-15 10:42:17 : To Jump, or not to Jump... : ju5tntime : https://www.reddit.com/r/suboxone/comments/juk1gv/to_jump_or_not_to_jump/

THAT.. is the question... =)

This is almost silly, but I’m sure you guys get it. 
I’m very knowledgeable about opioids, the addiction, and the withdrawal. I’ve been around here from time to time giving others advice on getting clean...

The thing is, when it comes down to giving myself the advice, it just feels like a conflict of interest. 
I had 5 years clean from the big H, but i herniated a disk and relapsed. The pain was terrible, I couldn’t seem to get relief from doctors, their cortisone shots, and the opioid crisis made them look at me and treat me awfully. 

I’ve been on 16mg of suboxone now for about a year, and I’m starting to really wish to be off it, but that’s complicated. I worry my back pain is there waiting for me. Sometimes it still rears up, and quite possibly I’m not having to feel it because I take subs. I also still get this crazy wtf-pain in my left testicle. Doctors and urologists dismissed me, thought I was drug seeking even when I flat out said, “I DONT WANT ANYTHING. I WANT IT FIXED!” and told me it’s ‘vericocele’ and I’m going to have to deal with it. “It doesn’t usually hurt” they say as they look at my swollen junk. Thanks, opioid epidemic. Thanks ridiculous hysterical urologist. Can you believe I turned down drugs from this guy, literally asked him to cut off my ball, and he was a dick to me? 

There is the benefit of having that constant safety net. I see a counselor, I have a dying/dead 8 year relationship, but I am starting to feel like I’m not myself. At first it was nice having that little boost, and those filled receptors. I still get it sometimes. It was nice having my more negative moods and emotional tendencies blunted, but I’m starting to realize I may just feel all around flat; always in neutral.

I used to be against MAT until I relapsed, and needed it to keep my life together. I had gained too much ground to keep failing at cold turkey. When I finally committed myself to it I felt converted. In a way I still do think it’s probably the safest bet, but I also think this growing uncertainty will do just that.. continue to grow.

I am having a hard time getting really zealous about committing to going down though. I’m scared of going back to the state I was in when I was trying to get clean before this; taking subs, trying to stop, and then doing both subs and heroin. Things get crazy when you’re in that stage. It’s a ...transition.

Would anyone mind sharing their motivations and experience if they’ve been through something similar? I am sort of feeling like if I have to take anything for the back pain I am capable of having from this herniated disk issue, then I’d prefer that it’s this. I tried gabapentin and all that type of stuff. For stupid addict reasons and just the way it affected me... I much prefer opioids. They work. I don’t have seizures if I run out, I just feel like hell.

Should I just count my blessings and not get too deep thinking about it? I think I’m capable of doing that. Sometimes I have these stupid thoughts like, what if something terrible happens and I suddenly can’t get my medicine, what if the apocalypse happens... I can get this done now and be good! Really, stupid, catastrophic what-ifs.. I don’t know if that’s unique to me. Sometimes like I mentioned I feel like I’m not myself anymore. Like I’m just...coasting through life... the absence of overly negative thoughts and feelings that come with addiction really has a way of making me feel like a zombie.

Okay, sorry for talking too much. I just know how the ads like this often end up in requests for more details. You can’t help if you don’t have a big, candid, embarrassing picture. There it is.

Thank you.

2020-11-15 10:42:40 : 28 [M4F] UK. Perhaps we're looking for the same thing : lahire87 : https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/juk1l9/28_m4f_uk_perhaps_were_looking_for_the_same_thing/

I'm  a Serbian-Scottish guy living in England. I'm pretty reserved, more  introverted than extroverted I reckon , but very open and affectionate  with someone that I am close to and trust. I'm hoping to find my person  for a LTR, though starting as friends is also absolutely fine!

It  matters to me that I find someone who is as empathetic, honest, loyal  and as fun as I am. You'll probably have to be a little weird and  certainly have a sense of humour. Both of which help massively.

I  enjoy kino films such as "Drive", "Princess Mononoke", "The Thing"  (1982) and anything by Stanley Kubrick. I like hiking (esp hill  climbing), comedy, some cycling and swimming, kendo and computer games. I  currently work in chemistry and studied microbiology at uni. I'm  interested in history and nature more than anything else and tend to  take the chance to read up more about them while I'm at "work"  because... well I'm slightly naughty.

I agree 100% with Nietzsche when he said that "*Life without music life would be a mistake.*”  I'm into almost anything from classical, metal, electronic, medieval,  80s, rave to doomer. Throw me some of your favourite bands or songs, I'd  love to check them out.

If  you're interested send a message and let me know where you are, what  you want to find with a bit about yourself! I have truncated what I  could here so have certainly missed out something that you find  important, so any questions just ask.    :\]

2020-11-15 10:43:06 : 16 Haus of Gloi reviews, including winter and fall scents : Butterfly_pants : https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/juk1px/16_haus_of_gloi_reviews_including_winter_and_fall/

Hello Hello! I've ordered more samples from Haus of Gloi so you'll have a bunch of reviews. Little note: i don't seem to ever get cake/biscuit notes and they've only rested a day.


**Almond Caramel Expresso Cake** : *fluffy cake with expresso frosting, toasted almonds and a caramel drizzle*

This is AMAZING, it smells like a reall fancy latte, i don't get the cake part but it's well blended and not overtly sweet. 
And most importantly, on my skin the coffee doesn't go straight up PINTO BEANS, it just stays this warm delicious scent. 10/10


**Pumpkin Patch** : *Dried leaves, twisted vines, orange pumpkins, golden amber and earth.*

This one was straight up **disgusting** to me, It smells like dried leaves, vines and curry. Which is not appetizing or nice at all and it stayed for HOURS. 
0/10, want to destroy for the good of humankind.


**Beguiled** : *Lemon cake made with the tang of fresh buttermilk and raspberry coulis - an otherwise innocent cake corrupted by cardamom and deceptive pink peppercorns.*

The beginning of Beguiled is great, very fresh and citrusy and then out of nowhere, BAM, heat and scent of peppercorns. Which honestly really ruins it for me. 3/10


**Lavender Sugar** : *Bulgarian lavender and a heaping spoonful of pure Muscadovo sugar.*

Weirdly, I don't hate it, even though i hate Lavender with a passion. It's okay, sweet and  i'm just indifferent to it. Gave it to my grandma. 4/10


**Herb Garden** : *Sun warmed tomato leaves, with rosemary, parsley, and mint.*

Now this one I was excited about, I've been looking for a tomato leaf scent ever since i smelled an H&amp;M candle of it. Herb Garden really delivered on my expectations, fresh, a bit citrusy, with a certain soapiness, I really like it. 8/10


**Blood Orange Marshmallow** : *Rich blood orange and fluffy white marshmallows.*

This one is just straight up blood orange for me, straight from the Bottle. On the skin though, the marshmallow takes over almost completely, you only get the ghost of the blood orange. A bit disappointed since i really like citrus scents. 5/10


**Odette** : *Clean sun dried linens, tuberose, ginger lily and white musk.*

A resounding YES, it's a very white floral and clean your skin but better scent. The best way i can describe it is a mix between a baby's smell, white florals and fresh fabric softener.
10/10


**Pink Marshmallow Milk** : *Magical pink berries and frothy cold milk.*

It's everything I wish the Blood Orange Marshmallow was. Perfectly blended &amp; sweet, you get both scents, the berries aren't tart at all but still recognizable. Honestly it gives me Libra vives, so I'll be giving it to a Libra friend.
6/10


**Violet Elixir** : *Sweet violets, fresh grass, petitgrain, and bergamot.*

This made me realize i f*cking love violets. It's so fresh and marine, with just an undertone of citrus. 10/10 


**Spider Silk** : *delicate water mint, wispy grey musk, crystalline webs of amber, oakmoss, torchwood, copaiba resin, and a touch of withered violet leaf.*

This really confuses me, it smells like bleach, then a bit fresh but with creaminess? I don't if i like it or not but i keep trying to smell it.
5/10


**Snow Covered Cranberries** : *Bright red cranberries covered in sparkling snow with a touch of cedar.*

This smells like my favorite Candy! Those fully strawberries by Haribo that are a bit sour. 9/10


**Kamala** : *Sweet mango, vanilla bean, and dragon's blood.*

This smells like a lusher more tart version of mango, it reminds me of passion fruit or litchi. I get no vanilla bean or dragon's blood although there is a creaminess to it. 8/10


**Rosy Cheeked** : *Pink grapefruit, fir needles, juniper berries, rosemary, a sprig of parsley and bright winter lilies.*

I smell grapefruit, metal, florals and talc. The metal disappears when the perfume dried drown but is potent from the bottle. Either way, a great scent, has a really welcome edge. 9/10


**Samhain II** : *Freshly turned earth, wet leaves, and a cool specter ridden wind!*

Another stunner! Smells like a very herby garden right after rain and i bloody love it. 9/10


**Sanctum** : *Muskmelon, coconut water infused with bergamot flower, kaffir lime, polished ho wood and sticky benzoin.*

Smells like i'm inside of a watermelon with a hint of citrus. Quite masculine scent, my father loved it so i gave it to him.
8/10


**Revelry** : *Rainwater soaked strawberry shortcake with a sprig of mint.*

Strawberry, sweetness and fresh water is all i can smell and it's a great combo. Luckily the mint doesn't show up. 7/10

I have a query regarding the Degree Name and Type of the Degree I have obtained from my university. I need this information as I am applying to Masters Programs and immigration where this information is of importance.

On my Degree AND Transcript, it clearly says 'Bachelor of Software Engineering'. 

There are many degree types such as BA, BSc, and BE.

Question 1: My degree falls under the category type of BE (Bachelors of Engineering) right?

Question 2: If so, Is the official name 'Bachelor of Software Engineering' or 'BE (Bachelor of Engineering) in Software Engineering'? 

Moreover, does all of this make any significant difference?

My girlfriend of one year felt like she couldn’t be in a relationship anymore because she was not in a good place in her life and it would be unfair on my part. She was going through a lot of life problems and family issues, or outside stressors and factors that were affecting our relationship and ability to spend time together. When we were together and go to spend time together, I knew we enjoyed it, but it was slowly becoming more limited. We are both in our mid twenties, and live in very family-oriented dynamics.

In our last talk before our break up, I made it clear I wanted to do everything I could to be supportive, loving, and caring for her, if she would let me in and do so. Of course, we had some issues to work out, but I confided that if we are willing and we feel the same, we could work through it. However, she confided she was worried about us everyday and her guilt only grew that she couldn’t make the time and energy to even talk as often anymore; she could barely keep up a conversation anymore. That’s when I knew she was really at her limit and needed to let us go so she could be present in addressing her life and getting to a better place.

She had a lot in her plate and was very clearly overwhelmed, exhausted, and unable to have time to take care of herself. Her and her parents were working 60+ hour weeks (Saturdays as well) for their small family corporation, finishing her last semester of college, and shouldering heavy family emotional weight. (Her youngest brother was depressed and feeling suicidal, and felt more comfortable living at her new house. Her family heeded his wishes and are now spending more time at her private home, making it so she has to do a lot more work to take care of them just like when she was younger and living under their roof; she comes from a family of 6.) Also note, she had not told her parents about our relationship yet, fearing we weren't ready for it. This is due to the fact that her parents are DEVOUT Catholics, and I am raised Buddhist. Although we both of the same Asian culture, they would be disapproving unless I converted, and she felt that was pressure we didn't need to deal with yet.

Because of this, it was difficult for us to even spend time, see each other, or even get private time. I would only see her for a handful of hours once every two weeks. I was happy to give up these wants so she could be focus on her problems, but I knew it would just make her feel terrible and guilty. As much as I didn’t want to let her go, I agreed to break up because we only want what’s best for each other. We still love each other very dearly, and agreed we’d be there for each other if we really need it. She told me thank you for everything and for being the best boyfriend she could ever have. I’ve come to accept that maybe the biggest act of love is to let a relationship go when you know you aren’t being good to someone, no matter how much you love them.

It’s bittersweet and confusing, because I know this is what she needs right now. This time and space to be there for her family, and most importantly, for herself; so she can start to feel happy again. I’m unsure how to handle being there for her, or how much distance I should make for myself, but also care about her. I don't know if I can let go of us and these feelings for her so easily. I don’t know if I should be hopeful for another chance, when the time is better for the both of us. I love and miss her dearly, but understand that right now, life has not been kind to her and can’t be with me right now because of it. How should I proceed forward? Wiling to listen to any advice or perspective on this.

Any suggestions?

2020-11-15 10:43:43 : Continued Education : stoques : https://www.reddit.com/r/Reformed/comments/juk1yf/continued_education/

I’ve been considering seminary (namely MBTS) for quite some time now but more actively these past few months. The time I realize I had (in light of the pandemic), brought about a particular interest in further understanding scripture. I serve at my local church (Southern Baptist) as a worship team member/leader to which I’ve been a member of for all of 3 years.

A quick [secular] background. I’m a designer/developer by trade and I have been since I graduated college. I’m 25, from LA, and I’m afforded, by my work, the ability to work remotely for the foreseeable future. Though I have no intention, at least until God reveals to me that calling, in serving in pastoral ministry, I’ve come to see the increasing need for good [classical] theology even in music and just in every day life.

My goal is ultimately leadership at whatever capacity. Be it leadership in church, leadership as a father or husband, etc. Nevertheless, my goal is to gain a deeper understanding of God simply because I think it’s responsible as a Christian.

I’m mainly looking for feedback from people who’ve experienced going to seminary with similar circumstances (moving out of state, working full time while pursuing a Master’s in Theology, living alone, etc.). Tips, recommendations, advice, other feasible options. 

Devil’s advocates are encouraged. I’m all ears.

2020-11-15 10:43:57 : Agile vs waterfall vs whatever : jackoffson_bollocks : https://www.reddit.com/r/projectmanagement/comments/juk20w/agile_vs_waterfall_vs_whatever/

Some people here may have seen me on r/agile trying to figure out why my workplace, which is govt/NFP and not a tech company or agency, is trying to use Agile to complete a piece of bespoke software. We aren't building it - we're not coders - but they are insisting on using Agile or at least the skin of Agile, for the testing, data uploading and general fiddling around with it that we have to do once the devs (who are contractors) deliver something. My guess is that since the devs use it they feel they have to too.
I feel like Agile is a coping mechanism, designed to deal with poor decisions made by management, usually around resource allocation. It strikes me as a very odd and counterproductive thing to do to deliver a 'minimum product' when resources aren't limited, and work in 'scrums' and 'sprints' when there's no time crunch.
Everyone keeps referring to 'waterfall'' as well like it's a binary and the biggest criticism of it seems to be that it doesn't allow for clients or managers to change their minds. I don't understand why you would invest time and money training staff to be Agile when you could invest time and money training managers to make their minds up and not change them every ten minutes. And I don't understand why you would voluntarily choose to release something before it's finished. That seems extremely dangerous to me, like a plane trying to fly on one wing. They talk a lot about Agile as being more 'efficient' (which means 'cheap') and quicker which I don't see as a problem. I also don't see 'someone changed their mind' as a reason to bend over backwards. If someone doesn't know what they want, why's that your problem?
Basically I've never been involved in this kind of PM before and I don't know how to relate to it since it seems to have goals that are contrary to the operation of government and based on a) things that aren't the case and b) not having consequences for actions.
Is there a genuine benefit to using it in the public or NFP sector? Because to me it looks like a $20 solution to a 5c problem.

For a long time I just didn’t even try to entertain the concept of relationships. But there’s this person and I trust them immensely. They suggested a relationship, but I felt like crying because I didn’t know what to do. I can say “I love you” to someone because that’s how I show I care and I’m fine with physically being touched. But the meaning isn’t there for me. I’m happy being close to this person, but the thought of going through romantic things makes me feel sick or uninterested. I almost pulled away out of fear of having to go through it all. But I just felt so relieved when they understood, I always felt like people wanted to fix me because of this. They know I will never be infatuated, nor will I ever be able to see them like they see me. I care for them and they are special to me. But a small part of me is uncertain because if I feel people getting romantic I usually feel like running since I cannot reciprocate and it’s hurts to know that I might be hurting them due to that.

i know little about Assassin's Creed, i read a bit about the whole AC lore, i watched the movie and only played black flag and Syndicate

The finger cutting bothers me a lot as it does not make sense:

&amp;#x200B;

1. The hole parkour becomes harder as they have less clamping force in their hands - makes it harder to hold on to things
2. if they are a secret organization the missing finger gives them away
3. if the blade was mounted on top of the hand they would not need to cut a finger and it would be easier to stab, or not?

&amp;#x200B;

can someone please expalin this better?

And its legal, and you do it while wearing a mask, and not one of you protests it, smacks it out of the hands of others or condemn them for the lives they take every year through second hand smoke. 5 million people a year pay thousands of dollars to die and kill with them and not one of you assholes wearing a mask are talking about it. People will literally wear a mask, and smoke fucking cigarettes, then yell at people for not wearing one. The mental gymnastics you idiots go through to make these justifications are ridiculous. You got worked up about a virus. Admit it and move on. Covid 19 will be here forever, everyone will get it, and it was never killing tons of people unless you lived in a dem state which had the harshest of all the lockdocks, precautions and highest death rates.

I'm a 35M from the USA, my crush is a 30F from Kosovo. We both live in Europe. Recently we've been trying to get together for playdates with our kids by texting but the last two times our respective kids were with the wrong parent for us to meet up.

So basically I have time to kill. I can't flirt by texting because that would just be awkward as hell since the premise for us hanging out is so that our two kids (both 7 years old, in the same class) can hang out sometime while they are not at school. But I don't want too much time to pass because that will give her time to just find someone else if I'm not moving my butt. The way our conversation left off was her saying "she hopes that we can get together another time" and I told her that I would message her the next time I had my kid for the weekend (which will be in 2 weekends, but I haven't told her so as to not sound too desperate).

I'm looking for advice on what to when we finally meet up. I'm sure there will still be Covid, so besides going for a long stroll the 5 of us (she has 2 kids) I don't see any other option. I guess that could be nice, because walks have a tendancy to clear everyone's head and make them open up, but they aren't very intimate.

How do I keep to the point and set up a playdate with this girl but still make it clear that I'm crushing on her? She knows I'm single and has recently been actively trying to get us to hang out (though it has taken several months for messages to start materializing).

Can anyone think of any creative ways that don't come off as creepy (if she doesn't reciprocate) I can do to flirt during these Covid times?  Maybe an outfit I can wear? My only thought is to try to play Mr. Responsible/Serious man as much as possible, saying that I just bought a house. Are there any conversation topics you would avoid? Anything else you guys and gals can think of that would be great.

2020-11-15 10:45:14 : Again to you C as always from Me as always.... : SocraticMagPie : https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/juk2j7/again_to_you_c_as_always_from_me_as_always/

Awake in the early hours by myself as usual. Awake because I was woken again because of shit ass dreams again because you had me trudge up my past so you could have that for me remember? You said you would bare those beasts of burden for me. Yet as I lay there in bed staring wide awake for over an hour I was more worried about you. Why do I do that? Why do I care about you? Why do I care about a lot of the people in my life? 

As the rain came down I contemplated pack a go bag and leaving. Telling not a soul alive. Would *you* miss me? Would call me at that point or would I get the standard text? Which let's both be honest here I initiate the text conversations. I also don't think I am that important to you. Your often late for our times to see each other. You don't display any of the usual things a woman does when she likes you or interested. I know, I know not all woman are created equally! Yet humans as a species *are* you see tend to react in certain ways when they're around someone they're attracted to and are interested in romantically. They get fidgety sometimes or more flirty or anxious. You don't start the texts or reach out to me much anymore. I am fairly certain last week you were trying to make me jealous by telling me about your husband. But you should know that I don't have time for jealousy nor do I care about him. He can't do the things I can. 

I think that you want me, miss me and have feelings for me. Feelings that your struggling with right now. I think your no longer in love with your husband and your bored with him. I think your just afraid to make the move I keep telling you to make. I think your unsure of me. I think your past is as muddled as mine. I think your just like me. You just want to be held and loved and told everything is going to be ok. I think your husband ignores you and forgets about you all the time. He doesn't care about you like I can and will. 

Again maybe I am.wrong. Either way, this is all your choice. This is on you. Its your life. I am just waiting for you. With this black eye I carry with me is a reminder of how life has pummeled me over and over this year. First this stupid pandemic, then my own health shit, then my moms major health which I am carrying on my own shoulders. I wander through the days so exhausted that I can't wait to crawl into my bed every night. Sometimes I take naps just to make it to the night when I can sleep. Often my sleep if consumed with dreams of you, everything is you lately. What it would be like to be with you. Not just in sexual ways. I am not just some sexual fiend I do have an intellectual mind as well. I do want to know your mind as well. I respect your intelligence. I want to share laughs with you and make memories. The places you asked me if I had ever been I would love to go with you someday you can be tour guide and show the me best places to go and see. 

I find women like you to be the best women to be with romantically. Your more settled in life. You know what you want. Your confident and you don't need someone to guide you, your know how to get it and you take it. Your beautiful, stunning, gorgeous. When life throws you a curveball you can catch it or knock that shit out of the park. I have been with women similar to you - your age. I find that those were always my most favorite and most adventurous and fun relationships and most exciting ones, most romantic and yea sure most sexual, most intimate and passionate ones too. 

On the flipside of the coin. I am with someone 2.5 years younger and I am seeing pros to that too but I gotta admit the drawbacks are rather intense and strong and can feel frustrating. I dont like having to teach or help be a guide to someone or do all the cooking because their parents didn't teach them. Or deal with their lack of things of certain areas. Or helping them find their independence. I know to expect things of them when they don't have as much maturity because they didnt have as much life experience as I did because of how I grew up vs. Their very sheltered life isn't fair. But its frustrating. I grew up rough they grew up babied and being given everything all the time so they expect things to be handed to them. They cheat and cheated on me because I dont give in and I am not saying its any excuse for me to reach out and want this from you, in fact it makes me just as bad to scold the one I am with. But I am exhausted. These sleepless nights, taking care of my mom, helping my younger spouse face reality they're heavy burdens. I long for the days I was in a relationship with someone older than me. Not just someone or anyone. Not just anyone will do. 

Only you will do. ONLY YOU C. And I am starting to lose hope. I am starting to drift further and further from all sights of land. Just me and wreckage. The sharks are starting to circle and I am starting to waste my energy fighting them off. 

I need that sign real soon.

2020-11-15 10:45:06 : I have an interesting theory about Jason's hallucinations in season 5........... : trapped585 : https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueBlood/comments/juk2hc/i_have_an_interesting_theory_about_jasons/

 So I know in the season 5 finale after Jason's gets hit by the faerie light, he starts having hallucinations of his dead parents who express a lot of anti-vampire sentiments, and even start encouraging this behavior in Jason. When I first saw this, I assumed this was just a combination of Jason's head injury, the side effects of the faerie light, and his growing anger towards vampires (which had been building up for most of the season), and that his parents were just hallucinations.

However, we find out later in season 6 that Sookie and Jason's parents tried to drown Sookie as a kid when they found out that Warlow (a faerie-vampire) was coming to collect their daughter. Even in season 6, Sookie's dad tries it again when he possesses Lafayette and kidnaps Sookie to kill her.

At the time, I was confused by the motivations of the Stackhouse parents, and thought it didn't make any sense.

But then I remembered Antonia's arc in season 4: One of the things she mentioned is that after being burned at the stake, she spent 400 years trapped in the afterlife unable to move on and nearly driven to insanity by her hatred of vampires.

What if the same thing happened to the Stackhouse parents? What if they have spent years trapped in the afterlife, unable to move on, and their fear/hatred of vampires magnified to an intense extent?

What if the hallucinations that Jason saw in season 5 weren't hallucinations, but were actually the spirits of his parents egging him on? What if the faerie light that Jason got hit with allowed him to communicate with his deceased parents temporarily?

Like I said, it's just a theory I have. Let me know what you think in the comment section!

Chris was the best incoming freshman of  his class based on reputation, so I've always wandered why he chose Seido and not Ichidai, whose catchers have done next to nothing

It might sound stupid but weed helped me so much in my life.

I used to struggle with heavy insomnia and couldn’t fall asleep sometimes before 7am. Had panic attacks, anxiety and stress. This was heavily impacting my personal and professional life.

I tried different types of medications but none of them really worked.

2 months ago I started smoking weed before going to bed and it literally changed my life. I can now fall asleep at a decent time, wake up early and feel good. 

It relaxes me and prevents me from panicking. I am finally feeling happy after years and years.

Just. Thanks.

2020-11-15 10:45:51 : Delay to The Adventures of Bonnie for those who care : REDGANG69 : https://www.reddit.com/r/FNaFb/comments/juk2qt/delay_to_the_adventures_of_bonnie_for_those_who/

So yeah. Reason being is that Night 1 fucking sucks and Night 2 just feels like FNaFb 1 but without Freddy. 

But it isn't all bad news. In fact the delay is good. It will allow me to add new locations to the existing FNaFb 1 map (I got the inspiration to add new locations from FNaF+) and completely redo the game's intro (keep in mind that this is only for Act 1. The remaining Acts will stay the same until otherwise). 

So what new stuff will been added?

•Completely redone Night 1

•Added new rooms: Party Room 2; Backstage; Saferoom (more rooms planned to come, these are just the ones that are finished)

•Time Travel (Exclusive to Night 2)

•There are now 60 cameras compared to FNaFb 1's 10 (there will be side content so it doesn't get boring having to do cameras over and over again. Each camera will also be unique to add variety).

•New side content (bosses, dungeons, etc)

•More to come

So yeah. Just thought I should let you know about this.

TL;DR: Wasn't happy with Act 1 so I'm completely redoing it

2020-11-15 10:46:12 : Confusion regarding Degree Name and Type : down_up786 : https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/juk2ui/confusion_regarding_degree_name_and_type/

I have a query regarding the Degree Name and Type of the Degree I have obtained from my university. I need this information as I am applying to Masters Programs and immigration where this information is of importance.

On my Degree AND Transcript, it clearly says 'Bachelor of Software Engineering'. 

There are many degree types such as BA, BSc, and BE.

Question 1: My degree falls under the category type of BE (Bachelors of Engineering) right?

Question 2: If so, Is the official name 'Bachelor of Software Engineering' or 'BE (Bachelor of Engineering) in Software Engineering'? 

Moreover, does all of this make any significant difference?

2020-11-15 10:46:24 : Blood Voyage - 2 quality of life changes would make Hellebron's campaign a lot better : _Constellations_ : https://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/juk2xd/blood_voyage_2_quality_of_life_changes_would_make/

Currently, Blood Voyage as a faction always moves last in every turn. It should be moved forward to have it's turn first after the player ends his turn. 

* This way the following situation can never happen again: Blood Voyage destroys a gate fortress in Ulthuan, and finishes the current turnt with that. Next turn the player does whatever, clicks end turn. The high elf AI will resettle the the gate fortress on Ulthuan and the Blood Voyage army has to  fight it again and yet again cannot move through it, stuck in an infinite loop of killing itself.
* By moving the Blood Voyage faction forward in the AI turn quoue, not only it ensures better coordination and cooperation with the player but allows it to reap it's positional rewards it fought for.

Currently Blood Voyage always spawns at Har Ganeth, the capital city. The issue here much like with the unique rite heroes CA already changed that it takes forever for them to get anywhere. The ability to choose from which owned port city the Blood Voyage starts it's killing journey from would be a great quality of life change that other factions with a similar mechanic already recieved by spawning the rite hero next our LL. 

* Blood Voyage could be added to the Black Ark tab on recruitment screen allowing the player to choose from which port the Blood Voyage starts from, putting greater ephasis on expanding in a strategic way to make ports near Ulthuan more threatening
* Regardless if this happens, Har Ganeth - Hellebron's capital - is currently spawning an always starting on sea lord, but the city itself has no port slot. The city could be moved a tiny-tiny bit towards the shore, be updated to an 8 slot capital and have 1 slot dedicated as port, OR leave it at 6 slots and change the main settlement building to have a port built into it (+population, income, and allowing trade on sea, all of them being a tiny bit of help for Hellebron's really bad economy as she eats up thousands of slaves every few turns).

2020-11-15 10:46:19 : Help need relationship advices : lulabiesss111 : https://www.reddit.com/r/isfp/comments/juk2w6/help_need_relationship_advices/

Hello, I'd like to confide in and ask for advices and perspectives if you don't mind

Im ENFP-F22 has been in a long distance relationship with this ISFP-M18 Amazing, it's been 10 months! (We never planned to date before so that's why you guys saw a 4 year age difference😅)

So we love each other so much, we know that, we get along really well, we always talk and communicate about everything EVERY SINGLE DAY 10 MONTHS WITHOUT skip, if we skip it we will miss each other

Then because we love each other so much and really live in different lives and cultures, he finally decided to move and adapt to my culture and religion a few years from now, his end goal is to be with me and marry me🥺❤

But from then on I felt like I became a little bit controling (because he wanted something serious aka future marriage) so I was really really jealous when he had a few girl friends, so it made me feel insecure and think too much and unconsciously created negative thoughts like "he does flirtatious things with his girlfriends etc.", REALLY are hard times for me because you know like MY THOUGHT WAS TOO STRONG, IT FELT REAL! 🥺 and I kept talking about it with him, I need him to convince me that nothing happened

After going through those hard times, then we got along as usual again, because he needed to save some extra money to one day move to my country so he decided to join the Army while still in college! 😭❤❤

He then went to basic training at the end of October for 2 months,

But then a day after that I found out he recently still followed his 2 exes on insta🥺😔 it really broke my heart.. I mean after all the magical conmection we had, why does he still want to be friends with his exes again? And also the same day I found him writing something to one of his online girl friend saying "I love you so much, you are my lifeline, I need you please forgive me" on July 5th, idk what friendship / relationship is he have with this girl.. but it really hurts me
 
so I really need advice from yall, should I continue this relationship or decide to break up with him? I mean, if the reason he's doing these things is seeing me thinking too much and being so insecure in our relationship so decided to seek his love need from other people than talked about it to me or seek solution together then he mybe dont love me anymore??? 🥺😔 idk what should I do honestly, I can't talk to him about this because he couldn't use the phone during his time in the army till December ,, I just want to know the ISFPs perspective on why he did that? I want to know the reason in your opinion and want to know what kind of action should I take on him or what should I do now? And also do u guys mybe have advices that i can improve or change as his partner?

Thankyou so much and sorry for bad english

Hello folks! Really enjoy the sub but haven't posted, and with an inability to actually play anywhere I'm obviously doing the smart thing and making loads of battlescribe lists out of the minis I have painted. I've been toying with the following as a completely damage-light but horrible to shift list.y question really is, do you think it would actually *work*, playing the objectives? It has effectively no anti-tank at all but my hope is that it'd just be a nightmare to chew through, and the Ark and Szeras keep reanimating and rando-buffing warriors. Most likely the 'eternal expansionist' combo but I'm open to persuasion. Scarabs are there to grab and hold objectives that the warrior blobs can't reach in time etc.

I was reading a research paper and I noticed that it utilized normal indents *and* blank lines followed by no indents. I assume the latter was used to demarcate sections. Is there a particular name for that style of indentation?

I am a bronze/silver player and have had some trouble with toxicity/racism/homophobia/griefing recently. Blizzard's moderation is so bad in the lower ranks that it's about 50/50 on whether a game will have someone targeting someone specific with insults/griefing/bullying. I have to report several people every time I play. I'm done with dealing with that, and I feel broken from it. I normally am at a 60% win percentage, but after being bullied very hard (I was playing as mercy and had hog and lucio guarding the spawn doors for the whole game) I lost like 18/20 games. I thought I was fine. Apparently not. Anyway I'm done until [Blizz gets their shit together](https://youtube.com/watch?v=t2Yrz9HSZNo), but here are some tricks I learned to avoid toxicity:

- if you have a really bad game (even if you don't think you are tilted) you should exit the game. There's nothing good to come from playing more
- reporting toxic people can be cathartic and can act as good transition to the next game
- cycle your avoid as teammates often. There's nothing worse than having the same asshole in two games in a row
- if you run into a lobby where most everyone is being toxic you should stagger your next queue by 5-10 minutes because toxic people end up grouped together because of avoid as teammate (thank you whatabottle for teaching me this, you absolute shining star here &lt;3)
- find another person to play with and talk to. Talk trash about the bullies over discord to relieve stress
- alternate randomly between qp and comp

I hope this helps some lower rank people who are just trying to enjoy their down time with a little gaming

This happened exactly on the 15th day I got my new phone. I hadn’t realized my phone’s not making any notification sounds (calls/msgs/alarms) for atleast a day - my old iPhone still rings when I get facetime calls so I wasn’t alert to the fact that the 12 wasn’t making a peep. I got a facetime call and my old phone rang, but I picked the call on my new phone and it got stuck making some loud horrible sound like it was possessed. I finally restarted my phone to make it stop. 

Then I realized it’s still not making any notification sounds (tried setting alarms, changing sound volume in settings) by now I was shi**ng in my pants for having just crossed the 14 day exchange period for my $1100 phone.  Another restart and it finally seemed to be doing what it’s supposed to. 

Then a couple of days later, the sound was automatically turned down to 0. I increased it again and have not seen other issues since. 

I periodically check if it’s still making sounds :(

Anyone else have a similar issue or have recommendations? I’m almost 3 weeks into owning this phone.

Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I've been doing an Android Developer internship with a company in Amsterdam lately, and should get my software engineering degree in the following months (not from a Dutch university). The company might offer me a contract to continue working with them, and since this would be my first time discussing a job contract, I have no idea what to expect, especially that I'm not from the Netherlands.

Can you please let me know what salary should I expect for such a position? Is it normal to ask for a salary that let me fully benefit from the 30% ruling? Do I fall into the category of "Young employee with master" for the 30% ruling (I'm younger then 30)? Is there any other tax allowances I should be aware of besides the 30% ruling?

Any other contract discussion tips or guidance are highly appreciated.

Thanks all.

Title. I really struggle to wrap my head around why reddit admins are okay with these subs continuing to be a thing, especially considering the reddit admins have been accelerating their tendency towards political correctness in the last 2-3 years. I'm not even sure where to begin describing why they should be banned, it feels like it should be self-evident. Not advocating for immoral or illegal activities is, like, kindergarten stuff. /r/IllegalLifeProTips doesn't even bother me *that* much, just kinda makes me scratch my head as to why the admins are okay with it, it's 50/50 on whether a post is asking for advice that's just illegal or also immoral. /r/UnethicalLifeProTips, though, bugs the living shit out of me. How can someone possibly post there in good conscience? How do you make a post *explicitly* asking for unethical advice, and then sleep well at night? Do the people who post there just go "Oh, well, I'm an asshole, oh well" or are they deluded into thinking they're living righteous lives worth being proud of?

Maybe I just need to make my morals more flexible, bring them in line with the rest of the world's.

Enemies are fantasy themed, and locations may vary from a forest, a haunted house, or a pirate ship. The bosses I remember is an undead pirate and a sorcerer with some kind of revolving ring at his back. The weird part about this game, is that bullets gained from the game, can be withdrawn for tokens, which means you can double or triple the tokens that you just inserted.

\[23 F\]

Hello, so... lemme save you the whole backstory to what triggered a panic attack, I'm having a lot of trouble at work with a certain co-worker who is trying to get me fired, which has caused my anxiety to go through the roof.

Now, I don't get panic attacks often, last time I had one was back in April, and before that it was when I was 15. This one... was probably one of the worst ones that I have ever expirienced. It lasted a good 45 minutes, and it was all so intense.

After I got some help from another co-worker and began to calm down, I noticed that my speech was being interupted by a lack of breathing ( I don't know if that's how to correctly explain it... have you ever cried so much that when you talk, it's choppy... basically like that...) I remember that being a common symptom with my last two attacks, but it would go away after a couple of hours and a good nights rest. It's been 3 days and although my speech has improved, this small tic of trying to catch my breath is constant.

2020-11-15 10:50:05 : Migrate hosts to new cluster : r00t82 : https://www.reddit.com/r/vmware/comments/juk475/migrate_hosts_to_new_cluster/

Hi guys,

I'm unable to  enable vSphere with Tanzu on a cluster that is managed with a single vSphere Lifecycle  image. In addition the single image also seem to prevent enabling Active Directory authentication for vSAN file services.

&amp;#x200B;

Question: What is the procedure to move these hosts to a new cluster where the single image is disabled? In addition to vSAN, the current cluster has a vDS for everything except the vSAN network, which is still on a vSwitch. Are there any guidelines? I'm only able to find instructions on how to move hosts between vCenters.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks a lot

2020-11-15 10:50:05 : X570 MAG 5800x High temps, no XMP : SafetyRock : https://www.reddit.com/r/MSI_Gaming/comments/juk473/x570_mag_5800x_high_temps_no_xmp/

Hi All,

Installed a 5800x into my X570 yesterday, updated to the latest bios V14.

First thing I did was enable my XMP on my 4000mhz ram which flawlessly performed with my 3800x however now causes crashing requiring me to reset the mobo. I understand this is a known issue. G.skill trident rgb and mystic light no longer control rgb of them either annoyingly.

The more important thing is with a 240mm aio which held a 3800x at 4.45 to 40-50 degrees is flying well and truly in the 90+ range at idle. Have ordered some thermal grizzly to repaste again but any ideas on if this is a board problem? Fans at at 1600rpm and barely touching the temps at idle. 

Finally has anyone else had issues with being unable to detect cpu temperature using ICUE or core temp ect. I can only get it through ryzen master or hwinfo. No 5800x temp package is being detected. Especially complicating my fan curves in icue but I am currently using motherboard sensor 6 as I believe that's the CPU.

2020-11-15 10:50:20 : How to link translated text with original text? : fizedek : https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/juk4ag/how_to_link_translated_text_with_original_text/

I have a quite programming challenge here. I want to develop an app in which user upload two books in different languages, and the app will tokenize book into sentenses. These sentenses then will be joined between original and translated text, so when I will read the book in foreign language, and when do not understand the sentense, I'll just click and translated sentense will be shown. The problem is how to link sentenses - I could not just use indexes of tokens, since it is not guarranted that it's translated 1:1. One sentense could be translated into multiple sentenses for instance. Also the translated sentense could be translated in way that particular words do not reflect each other, for example idioms. It doesn't matter, I can omit these, it don't have to be perfect. But it is another pain in term of difficulty of this app. What could be possible solution to this problem that I have in mind is to use diff, which will be modified to not compare string equality, but also the meaning (translation). But maybe some of you will advice something more sophisticated. Thanks in advance.

2020-11-15 10:50:34 : Suggestion: Better Death Animations : GamerAlex1411 : https://www.reddit.com/r/PhasmophobiaGame/comments/juk4dj/suggestion_better_death_animations/

I had a few ideas for this. 

1.) Death animation, the ghost is much more sudden and violent, and it's jumpscare-ish. I know that this game's fear is mostly based around anything but jumpscares, most of the time, but the normal death seems a bit weak for all the suspense and scares you go through. 

2.) Death animation, the ghost gouges out your eyes suddenly, snaps your neck, or suffocates you. 

3.) Skip the death animation, let's talk about the ghost's death room. The ghost. You. A light bulb that blows out. But then...nothing...ever. What would be suspenseful and terrifying, in my opinion, is if every time you die, when the light bulb shatters, you have a randomly generated 50% chance to be jumpscared by the ghost, with it suddenly appearing to you, face to face. 

4.) The ghost's death room. You start out in the far corner. The light blinks on and off. Each time the ghost is inching closer. The light turns on and it's nearly at you. The light bulb blows. After this, there's a randomly generated 50/50 chance that the ghost will jumpscare you, appearing in your face with a little face-to-face confrontation. 

5.) Any combination of the previous 4 suggestions.

2020-11-15 10:51:43 : What improvements would you like to see in video games for blind people and the visually impaired? : SigmaGamesStudios : https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/juk4qo/what_improvements_would_you_like_to_see_in_video/

This is a follow up on my last post in your subreddit, found here: [I am interested in developing a video game with sound design for blind people.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/jt41lm/i_am_interested_in_developing_a_video_game_with/)

I am working towards having a shooter game developed with no graphics, just a black screen and a new way of designing sound. This new way is hard to figure out for someone who can already see, so it's very important that I get expert advice, from people who already play games using sound only. And people in general who navigate through life using sound.

There are a lot of things most of us take for granted when playing games. We can see the enemy and predict what they are capable of because of the equipment they carry, how large they are, how fast they move and so forth. All this information has to become sound.

Since all things visual will now have to become sound, I'm very interested in all ideas on what games are typically missing when it comes to audio cues.

The technology to paint an auditory picture of the environment with echo, sound mixing for distance and all that already exists, but to my knowledge, no one has actually gone all the way to make a game that sounds as good as the best games look. That's what I want to achieve. When I play Call Of Duty Warzone with my eyes closed, it's impossible to win. Anyone should stand a chance of winning.

One thing I imagine when your character walks into a wall to the sides, is a sound on the correct side, where you hear the clothing sliding against the wall. If it's your shoulder, the sound will be higher up in the three dimensional sound mix for headphones, than if it's your knee. If it's your knee, you know you don't have cover and you might want to crouch. When we crouch in real life, we hear differently because the ears are now lower in altitude. Another challenge is to create some sort of a focused hearing mechanism, so that when you aim, the sound changes, or if a grenade lands too close to the player, the sound of that bouncing around would be amplified. In that case, you better know what direction to run in. If it's inside a building, you should know that there is a wall or a hallway which will affect your decision making. The bouncing sound, when reflected correctly, should be able to tell you about the environment. A wall has this thick reflection sound and a hallway has this thin reflection sound. If it's thin on the left side, you run to the left. Most games have graphical indicators with a picture of a grenade, which has to be replaced with sound.

Otherwise, what sort of a design would make for the ultimate user experience? If you had unlimited budget and could have anything you want created, what would you ask for?

Thank you for reading and enjoy your Sunday out there!

2020-11-15 10:51:42 : Eulmore is FF XIV Reddit. : MegaGamer235 : https://www.reddit.com/r/ShitpostXIV/comments/juk4qc/eulmore_is_ff_xiv_reddit/

Eulmore is one of the more interesting places in the First IMO. Vauthry’s corrupt paradise, where no man or woman wants for anything, and people are free from the burden of conflict because all their needs are provided for. But what if I were to tell you that Eulmore was a twisted reflection of Reddit? Specifically FF XIV Reddit.

Ridiculous you may say? MegaGamer235, you cringe poster, where are you going with this? You are most likely thinking, but hear me out, how did Alphinaud and us sneak into Eulmore? By pretending to be an artist and his assistant. And what floods the XIV normie sub? Soft core porn of Catgirls, I MEAN commissions. Yes Commissions that are completely safe for work. Sometimes crappy Au Ra jokes, and people starting up the game and getting upvotes for it. But mostly commissions. The artist who Vauthry tossed out of Eulmore represents all those artists whose work was downvoted by random people who hate their work, and struggles to get by. Vauthry took downvoting literally when he tossed him off the balcony it seems.

The people who struggle to get into Eulmore, represent the posters who are desperate to have front page attention but either lack a witty sense of humor or basic drawing skills, only when they find a niche for themselves are they allowed into paradise I.E the front page. And with how prevalent Catgirls are on the main sub, is it really a coincidence that Alphinaud is commissioned by a cat couple? I think not. They are more aware than you realize dear shit posters, they are getting onto us. How many times has Yoshi P called our community great? He knows. 


And no more is it apparent in how the great community of Eulmore worships Vauthry. Who is most likely a stand in for the developers. Think about the pent up sexual frustration faced by Japanese people and how Vauthry is basically a Hentai antagonist, then eventually Yaoi protagonist. Clearly, Vauthry represents the control the dev team, mostly Yoshi P has over the fanbase. And Meol is Mogstation gear. And Ran’jit is a mod. Ran’jit is as popular as a XIV subreddit mod anyway. Whatever moving on. 

Consider that Vauthry even has control over sin eaters, and think about how Sin Eaters used to be people. Sin Eaters are a metaphor for Shit Posters. They both even start with s. NOT A COINCIDENCE!!! Notice how even we respect Yoshi P despite shitting on him constantly in our posts? 

We are all Eulmore. They know, the dev teams knows. And what can we gleam from this? Well think about how the Exarch likes to flex sometimes. And how Eulmore gave him a letter...


In conclusion, u/Flexi-boot is confirmed for Smash.

Hey G., I miss you. 
It kills me knowing that you might not miss me back... 

It has been 2 months since our love story came to an end, but it felt like decades... Every song, every place, everything reminds me of you and our 4 and a half years we decided to spend together, side by side... 

I know we have been through rough times to say the least, but I swear on my own life that giving up on us never ever was an option for me. You were and still are my all and more, how could I let go? How on earth leaving me was that easy for you? 

Nothing matters now we are not together anymore, I took that road that apparently brought me straight down to hell, and I don't blame you for not wanting to ride along. But damn it hurts. Everything around me is so red, burning in flames, and not being able to see your sweet smile is making me catch fire, it burns, it hurts. 

I miss you. I love you. Please come back, because even hell would feel like heaven with you. I cannot escape this without you by my side, I am destined to wonder forever in this place, only you can save me. 

Just know this. 
Even hell would feel like heaven with you. 

With love, yours truly

Hello there, 

Before i start, i want to say that i have played world of warcraft for quite some time now, i started playing around 2006 on and off, i started losing interest at cata but happend to hop on and off again for a couple of expansions in the latter, for example legion, even raided mythic but than stopped. Since the last quarter of 2019 im back to classic and stayed there, but i looked into bfa and kinda was overwhelmed by the input. 

Right now, in limboing between classic and my love for retail, but everytime i log in i dont know which char to play. I have a hunter, pala, warry and warlock and all of them seem so hard to get in to and when i do, i actually am planless on what to do with them.. things like rotation and everything around the char are so complex right now. I seem to can't find my way into it. Do you guys have tips for addons, guides that are understandable and not so overwhelming?

Also I kinda want to start out again when shadowlands releases, but i think i need help rn to find back in again.

For some reason my housemate's cat loves chewing on my succulents, so they've been rehomed to the kitchen windowsill where he can't get to them. However I'd quite like to get some other plants for around the house.

Due to this I'm looking for plants which are:

* Non-toxic to cats
* Can survive a cat nibbling on them occasionally
* Is a good "beginner" plant (I've managed to keep some cactuses alive but would like to branch out)

I've found some lists of non-toxic plants, but have no idea which ones are more likely to survive both random cat attacks and my attempts at plant care!

Any ideas?

(GBP sheet, v2.9.5)

I went redid my personal asset allocation recently, which resulted in selling out of my managed funds and transferring to new ones. The total amount allocated to MFs though remained constant. However, after the sales, because the remaining units of my old funds went to zero, the "Historical Values (Automatic)" *Contribution* value (column N) became zero for all months prior to the current one, even as the market value was fixed. I expect this would happen to the Stocks and other tabs too. To show the net pay-in over time, should this contributions data be captured in the History tab and pulled from there?

For the past few years I've been really busy and maintained a very unhealthy work-life balance. This only got worse with covid once I started working from home and everything blurred together. I've been really struggling recently with anxiety, stress, and depression. I'm taking steps to get better though, including professional help and medication. I'm also trying to make more time for myself as I'm realizing how negative of an impact my work is having on my life. 

But as I'm creating time for myself, I'm realizing I have no idea what to do with it. It's been years since I've really just sat down and relaxed. Usually my free time is spent socializing, running errands, doing chores, browsing the internet or watching TV until I fall asleep. Beyond that I have no idea what to do or what I even want to do. I used to have lots of hobbies like reading, baking, hiking, gaming, but now...? I feel unmotivated to even start anything. 

The most I'm able to do is mindlessly play Animal Crossing, go for a walk, or call somebody to make the time pass by faster. I know this is absolutely not how it should be. It's like I've gotten so used to working and being busy all the time that I have no idea how not to be. Any suggestions on how to overcome this?

Hi all.

This started out as a question, but turned into a paragraphs long bio with way more information than necessary. Bullet points!

* 26, male
* clinically depressed with a few spoons of anxiety and mild ADHD, but a year or so of therapy and some meds has helped tremendously
* Had my proper date/relationship last year, it quickly became very passionate, but it was very short-lived and the way it ended kinda left me feeling like I was just a toy. Afterwards, I went back to school and focused on becoming someone I'm happy with, made an actual serious plan to attend grad school overseas because fuuuuuck this place, I feel better than I ever have.

So now you have that background. So here's the deal: I know that I'll never be "done" working on myself, but I think I've put in the work and reached a point where I should really be able to address that loneliness I mentioned, but I'm still.... completely lost. I'm still absolutely terrified of dating, and I don't know how to start with it. My IRL close friends leave a lot to be desired when it comes to advice, so I'm here.

I feel like I need to figure this shit out, and mentally, spiritually, I feel ready to, but I don't know how to start. I keep getting older and I really don't want to make it to 30 without attaining some semblance of maturity when it comes to dating or even just sex. I've come to appreciate how much more there is to life, and how valuable it is to be happy with yourself, but when it comes down to it... I can have confidence in my self-worth, my positive qualities, who I am, but it only goes so far when you're in uncharted waters. It's hard to have confidence in my attractiveness, in my viability as a partner in sex or in a relationship, when there's never been any real affirmation of it. Maybe if I had the time and energy to dedicate to just jumping into it and sinking or swimming, I'd figure it out, but that doesn't feel like an option. We're in a pandemic, likely to enter lockdown again soon. I work full-time and study full-time, which is kind of a fuckin' lot when you're also focusing so much on self-improvement and keeping depression at bay. I won't be done with school for at least 4-5 years, and midway through that I'll be packing up and moving to another continent. Going out with friends and meeting randos probably isn't in my future.

I remember that first date, last year. To be a bit more specific, the first kiss, and the make-out session that followed. It was this huge thing, something I'd dreamt about when I was a kid: getting physical with a girl I liked. Over the years, it started to feel like this impossible, distant fantasy, this thing that was for everyone else to do, but not me. And here I was, in this moment, with a possible opportunity, and suddenly, it felt completely natural and easy, like I could've been doing it all along. I didn't have to compromise, I didn't get piss drunk, I didn't pay for it, I just did it, and she reciprocated. It was like a switch flipped. And now it's reset to that original position, and I don't know how to access it so I can flip it back.

2020-11-15 10:55:07 : Unpopular Opinion: Nikol is Bad for Armenia : ManagerNo5206 : https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/juk5xq/unpopular_opinion_nikol_is_bad_for_armenia/

Before I am harassed for being an oligarch shill, let me do a short introduction. I am a researcher in cognitive science with a focus on language and I currently live in the Netherlands. I consider myself liberal, mostly left-leaning with moderate views on certain topics. I think democracy is the way to go not only for Armenia, but for the rest of our world. I am not paid by any oligarchs (I just imagined myself being paid by Dod to do his PR and it honestly cracked me up). In fact, I was once detained by the police during a protest against Serzhik's regime and I don't have a lot of fond memories about it. I was quite happy after the Velvet Revolution and have been proudly telling all my foreign friends about the flourishing democracy in Armenia. I am here to *discuss* and *share* my observations, *not to* instigate hate or division. I am not an expert, but I try to be well-informed. My loyalties do not lie with any political leader, but with the Armenian people.

* There is a personality cult around Pashinyan which is hard to ignore. I hear even the most reasonable people say things like, "Nikol is such a modest guy. He doesn't even own any palaces, can you believe that? What a nice guy, he truly cares about the people." This is just wrong. I would understand if people said, "We like his views on foreign policy" or "We agree with his stance on how this issue should be resolved" or "I completely share his ideology and I think that's the direction in which we should develop". But nothing of that sort; Nikol is the savior that bears the code for democracy in his DNA and if he goes, we will all burn in the fires of eternal  ~~hell~~ corruption and dictatorship. Even now, people are all over the place defending Nikol instead of saying something like, "We think his decision was the correct one and it is going to benefit us in the long term." Being nice just doesn't suffice in politics. We need a strong, competent, well-educated politician who is good at diplomacy, management and has a well-defined ideology. And if he is a nice guy too, damn, I will take it.
* Nikol is a populist, pretty skilled at demagoguery and showmanship. I never thought about this critically until now. I would advice to put your sentiments aside and watch his speeches without any emotion. Most of them have no real substance, just repetitions of things he knows damn well Armenian ears will love to hear. Heck, the guy thrives on show - fiery speeches, asserting his legitimacy every chance he gets, selfies, riding a bike like a boss and what not. If you ask me, it's populism that has gotten him this far, not the fact that he is a good politician.
* Nikol lied during the war, when all of us were counting on our government's transparency and honesty. A lot of people claim, "But he was pretty honest, he said many times the situation was dire." Aha. The situation was dire, but the reserve forces were clearly not necessary. In fact they even sent many volunteers away saying, "We don't need any volunteers at this point, everything is under control, no worries and stay calm." Honestly, I felt cheated and punched in the gut after I heard the news about the peace deal. Not because I am a warmonger, but because it caught me completely off-guard. I and everyone else around me had the idea, up until that very moment, that things were tough, but we were still kicking ass. Some were even speculating the war could go on for years.
* Nikol doesn't have an ideology and this is extremely dangerous. Not supporting any political ideology means you don't have any clear goals or direction, your actions/solutions are arbitrary and stemming from the needs of the moment rather than a long-term vision. Who has any idea about what direction Armenia is going? If you do, please tell me. Because I honestly don't. Yes, he is trying to root out corruption, but that's what any normal government should do at a bare minimum. What's next? A lot of his reforms are fishy as hell too.
* People equate democracy with Nikol's person himself, forgetting that democracy lies with the people. The people elected Nikol and the people can ask him to leave and elect someone else. If you try to keep Nikol in power at all costs, then you are depriving the people of their chance at democracy. Yet you say you don't even trust that the people will make the right choice. Then why do you even need democracy if you don't trust that the people have the ability to make good judgments about what's good for them?
* It is constantly repeated that there is no better replacement for Nikol. If we truly have no better options than a guy who fucked up our diplomacy in just two years, lost a war, lied throughout the entire war, and is now putting up live videos pointing fingers at everyone else and instigating hatred towards those he calls 'traitors', then there truly is no hope for us. I would say ANYONE at this critical moment is a stronger candidate than Nikol himself. There might indeed be a game of power grab going on, but there ARE many people who are neither in camp Nikol nor camp Oligarch. Yet they are automatically put in camp Oligarch and their voices are shut down.
* People having an extreme and almost mythical hatred towards the old regime to a degree that every single person who is part of HHK is villainized. Do you really think there is absolutely no single soul among them that truly cares about their homeland? I am not a fan of [this woman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWm37IhecyA&amp;feature=youtu.be), but do you really think she is faking it just to grab power in that particular interview? Or take [Vache Gabrielyan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vache_Gabrielyan), a very educated and competent economist who happens to be part of HHK. Honestly, if there is a candidate from HHK who has the potential to be a kick-ass leader and can potentially solve our current diplomatic mess and help with the negotiations, would you really object that just because they are from HHK? If yes, then how can you claim that you care about Armenia? Because the biggest problem Armenia faces at the moment is not corruption, believe it or not.
* My solution would be to form a coalition and try to solve this mess through united effort. After things calm down and people get some clarity, new elections should be held. This is for the people who claim you cannot express your opinion, unless you have a solution.
 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
2020-11-15 10:56:12 : Wwyd almost a year has passed, and i still have no internship certificate : mushlamb : https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/juk6ae/wwyd_almost_a_year_has_passed_and_i_still_have_no/

Hi there,
I know there is a pandemic going on, in fact, Covid was the reason my internship was cut short at the beginning of this year. I asked several times via email the people responsible for me, and via their website's contact form(which is actually meant for consumers feedback) for my certificate. I know the latter probably never reached anyone, because as an intern, it was one of my jobs to read and answer all the mails from this service, and the other interns rarely did that, so i am 99 percent convinced the current interns (if there are any, because Covid) probably do not look into the emails. As for the people responsible for me, they also get thousands of mails every day, so i thought nbd, but recently i cannot even write to them (i only get error messages from my email provider for trying). 

If i am really honest, it was a shitty job w racist and sexist people who made me cry every single day, and i basically learned nothing new.  For that reason, i am dreading to phone call or even go back there in person (whenever that will be possible again, because Corona). I am just wondering if it is worth it. I mean i worked my ass off and i did a pretty good job despite all circumstances. I just doubt any of them could write something good now that almost a year has passed. But i don't have much to put in my CV since this was only my 2nd internship ever. Then again, i am also thinking that this company - at least in this state and my desired future work field- has a bad rep to begin with.

2020-11-15 10:56:24 : The man in Burger King : Is_this_a_real_world : https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/juk6d9/the_man_in_burger_king/

It was around one week until by 21th birthday, and i had just started working at my first job, Burger King. It was in the middle of a small suburb in Sweden, and i stayed there for some years for university. I was educating to be a phycologist. 

The time was around 11 pm, i think. Honestly i don’t remember but i think it was around 11. It wasn’t many customers left, i think it was around like 2 groups of people there. I mean it wasn’t many people there. The music was playing hip-hop songs and me and my friends was dancing and smoking in the back of the kitchen. There was a bar just next to the restaurant and we were really drunk, all i remember is that guy that just sat on a table for more than a couple of hours. 

One hour later and i was about to end my shift and close the restaurant. I was the only employee left there, but i wasn’t scared, i’ve been there alone other times. The weird guy was still sitting right there on the same table, with the same exact pose. I told him that we would close now and he didn’t respond. I was telling him to fuck off, and my drunk self probably shouldn’t have done that.

The guy didn’t move and i thought he was asleep so i tried to wale him up. After a while i looked at his face and the next thing i saw was terrifying.

His eyes were red and he looked like he was dead, he was white all over his face. I felt that his heart didn’t beat and i immediately took my phone to call the police. My phone was out of battery. I slapped myself in the face and asked my drunk self several times why i was on tinder before all of this. I had no idea this would happen.

I had no clue on what to do and i thought that he has just took to much drugs, atleast he looked like one person who would do that. 

After a few minutes of looking at him, i noticed that a car pulled up to the building. I rushed out and knocked on the window. He had i hood on so i couldn’t see his face clearly. 

He took off his hood and showed me his weird looking face. He was bloody over all of his face and smiled at me while he took a knife out of his pocket.

I rushed never before and i thought i was gonna die! I came to the bar and rushed in it. I screamed to everyone in the bar about everything that had happened. I asked to borrow someone’s and i called a taxi and i went home.

I am now 27 and i still don’t know what that guy wanted from me that night. And why the other dude was dead. Maybe they were connected. Matbe the guy in the car killed the guy in the restaurant. 

Anyways, that’s my story.

2020-11-15 10:56:28 : Compose Mode- Watching video on the upper screen, and taking notes on the lower screen? : catseyepearl : https://www.reddit.com/r/surfaceduo/comments/juk6dz/compose_mode_watching_video_on_the_upper_screen/

Hi,

I always watch educational video and take notes on OneNote during my commute time. It's fine when I'm in book mode, I can play video on the left screen, and take notes with OneNote on the right screen. However, when I'm in compose mode so as to playing the video full screen on upper screen, and trying to type on the lower screen, the OneNote would automatically take up both screen.

So my question is, is there anyway I can "pin" an app to a specific screen, and is it possible to watch video and take notes at the same time in compose mode?

Thanks!

2020-11-15 10:57:53 : Wrong tooltips/tooltip suggestion thread. Many new items have wrong, missing, or misinterpreted tooltips that only cause confusion and inaccuracy. : dorfcally : https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/juk6v9/wrong_tooltipstooltip_suggestion_thread_many_new/

Off the top of my head from what I've noticed:

Sunfire Aegis does not need to tell how many legendaries you have. It should tell how much damage it's dealt, both on immolate and aoe burn.

Ardent Censer: Does not track times applied/on-hit bonus damage like it used to, it calculates the entire auto-attack, not the bonus on-hit damage. very misleading seeing it give 20-30k damage a game.

Staff of Flowing Water: Doesn't tell anything. Should tell times applied/bonus damage granted from abilities used while that person is buffed

Moonlight stone: Should specify it doesn't work on champion heals, except sometimes, if you have Aery or another effect to go along with it. It's very inconsistent. I think Soraka's Q HoT procs it, but not the heal ability itself.

The Collector: Does not tell you how many collections were made, like Triumph does.

Bloodthirster: Does not track shield absorbs

Demonic Embrace: No buff given to show armor/MR stacks

Abyssal Mask: Does not track bonus damage

Rapidfire and Stormrazor: rapidfire tracks damage dealt, but not stormrazor.

Kraken: tracks every 3 hits, but botrk and guinsoos do not. kraken also does not get bonus procs with guinsoos. This may be because of how they interact with autos, vs abilities/other attacks. Clarification is needed in tooltip.

Sanguine Blade: Doesn't track time fully activated, but how much you healed from its vamp.

Youmuu's: Does not track distance travelled with either effect

Frozen heart/warden's mail/randuins: Does not track damage absorbed, would be very useful stat

Spirit visage: Does not show bonus healing/shielding received

There are some others like Steraks and Stoneplate that should probably give you a buff stack count, and I'm not sure they do.

Presence of Mind: Doesn't separate its effects

There's some other runes that have weird tooltips too.


Some are nitpicky, but there's lots of inconsistencies with these tooltips. I also hate the "show icon but no words so you're left wondering what the fuck this icon/color combination means" on all tooltips. I don't have time to read an entire polynomial equation to figure out the numbers an item gives.

2020-11-15 10:57:51 : Issues with Desync : NemesisVS : https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/juk6uz/issues_with_desync/

Hey everyone. I'm having a problem with desync and I hope someone can help me with this.

The problem doesnt affect me, my game is running fine. But two of my friends (they are brothers and use the same internet) have the issue they are getting a desync almost every raid. This has been the case for over a year now and we haven't found any solution. They don't get kicked out of the raid like it would happen due to a high ping but at some point they cant open any more crates or move around stuff in the inventory. Also they won't see any other players or AI, those just keep walking on the spot. The only option for them to get into the raid again is a restart. 

Has anyone heard of similar issues? Like I said, we have been trying to solve this for a long time and nothing seems to work. They have no issues in any other games and the connection is stable. They both use a power-line communication to their router, might that be an issue? But as said any other game runs fine. Any help is much appreciated!

2020-11-15 10:58:49 : I’m just 18 and I’m so confused. People say I’m not ugly, but my life experiences say otherwise : TottenhamAreShit21 : https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelExit/comments/juk777/im_just_18_and_im_so_confused_people_say_im_not/

I’m in the first semester of my second year in University. I have made 0 female friends, meanwhile almost all my friends interact with girls on a daily basis. 

You might say I put no effort in having meaningful interactions with girls, which would be wrong. But even if I didn’t put effort, I feel I would be justified. Why? Because almost all my friends who do things with girls don’t put any effort in putting themselves out there. It literally just happens, like a girl asks them to walk with her, or she adds them first on Snapchat and starts a convo etc.

People say I’m not ugly, which I believe as well. My sister says the same thing. Some of my friends flat out don’t believe me when I say my dms are dry. One particular dude even went as far as saying I’m probably deleting the texts I get from girls, so I don’t come across as a fuckboy. In my head I was like “I wish I was the monster you think I am”.

But it’s hard to believe I’m attractive when I see how easy things happen for attractive people and I know for a fact they don’t happen to me.

I’m starting to think that the reason behind all this is my big ass five head. In my early years i got bullied a lot, got given the nickname Vincent Kompany (Google it) in high school. Nearly everytime someone makes fun of me, it involves my forehead. 

Even now, sometimes I catch girls staring at me with an expressionless look on their face. I used to cope and think they were attracted to me, but after some time I started fearing they are all just starting at my forehead lol. That theory is backed up by the fact that no girl that has ever looked at me, has made a move on me. Unlike with my normie friends, who regularly get girls approaching them and stuff.

It really doesn’t make sense. I’m tall, slim, have a good face imo, excellent hygiene. Imo have nearly all the traits of a traditionally dateable dude. Could it be that I’m abnormal looking?

2020-11-15 10:58:49 : Backup Strategy? : Tall-Guy : https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/juk774/backup_strategy/

Hi everyone!

Up until now, all my pictures were being stored on my PC, and once per 2-3 weeks I would connect an external USB hard-drive, and sync the information. Recently I took a project of digitizing the family history (which mainly means VHS-Tapes). I keep those in Lossless format, and now that I'm done, It's around 3T of information. 

However, I don't plan to watch those so often - that they deserve to be on the PC hard-drive. So I can get an external drive dedicated just for those lossless videos. What worries me, that because those are not part of the PC I'm using daily, I might not watch any video for like 1 year - connect the external drive and figure out somethings bad happened. I can get a 2nd external hard-drive of-course to have two copies - but again, as I will not often actually connect them - there's a rare scenario that one will go died, I wouldn't know that because I don't use it - and couple of months later the other will die. When i'll try to connect any a year afterwards, It will be late. That's no the case like photos I store on my PC - because if something happen to my PC, I can immediately plug the external backup and restore everything.

So I was reading about 3-2-1 and also checking for online storage. But I figured out that instead of buying another external hard-drive (I don't need the mobility), perhaps it's time to use a better setup. Some setup that perhaps check integrity - so even if I won't be using those hard-drives, sometimes will make sure they still work. A plus would be somethings that is not constantly mounted, as I don't want to fall into a virus that will encrypt all my PC files along with the remote storage. I prefer to mount those external storage only once per 2-3 weeks when I want to do a backup. 

I was looking at NAS, but I'm not sure I need that mini-PC (as I don't need other interfaces like FTP, SMB etc). Hard Drive Docks seems better, but they do not have any kind of integrity or data verification.

Ideas? :)

2020-11-15 10:59:06 : Nightmare US/UK dual citizenship tax issue : Ok-Fan-3321 : https://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/juk7ae/nightmare_usuk_dual_citizenship_tax_issue/

I was born in the US and haven't lived in the country for 15 years and feel quite British. None of my family live in the US anymore which makes this situation even more ridiculous.

I just tried opening up a stock and shares ISA from vanguard and I realized that I'm not allowed to due to being a US citizen. And this has opened up a can of worms where I've started investigating the implications of my US citizenship.

I haven't ever filed any US tax returns because nobody has ever told me I have to. I haven't had any income until 2017 and I've worked minimum wage jobs until recently.

Am I going to owe a huge amount of money to the IRS and have to pay an accountant a load of money to sort this out? I'm worried about the implications on my pension too because I've heard the US may tax me on it.

It costs $2500 to renounce my citizenship but it seems like it won't solve these previous tax issues.

2. Used LOL as punctuation
3. Begins sentences without a capital letter
4. Pluralizes with an apostrophe

6. Uses ANY form of txtspeak

I did some Googling but did not find a clear answer. Maybe there is someone here who understands chemistry and can weigh in on the issue. 

I wanted to know what contributes o the bitter taste in tea and coffee and if they are perceptually different. For example could someone claim that the bitterness in tea is stronger than in coffee?

As I understand the bitterness in tea can come from catechins or tannins and from caffeine itself. In coffee propylthiouracil [PROP], quinine and caffeine.

The perception of bitterness itself is linked to genes and varies from person to person.

Well. I woke up on Thursday. I was still tired and my sisters are telling me “hey we need to tell you something” and I was like what on earth could it possibly be that you want to tell me? Because they usually would probably say something that I don’t care for but then they told me and at first I didn’t care but then fast forward to today i honestly don’t know what to do. They had told me they’re had been rumors from my family in Mexico that my dad is gay. I’m not 100% sure if that’s the case but I wanted to know myself so I called him. Btw I haven’t since him since 2017 I believe and my parents have been divorced since I was about 4. So it’s been awhile since I’ve spoken to him. Anyways I gave him a call and I wanted to tell him about the rumor but I didn’t want to get straight into the point so I was talking to him about how I now have a job and I have my license and stuff. It got pretty emotional because we haven’t since each other in so long so it was hard for him to know that I was growing up without him. It’s hard for me as well knowing he wasn’t here to watch me and I’m scared that I won’t be able to see him in time. So yeah I didn’t ask him because it just wasn’t a good time to ask a question like that but I have a feeling that he is because when he was taking to me, he told me in Spanish that whatever I do in life don’t think about what others say do what you wanna do and don’t listen to anyone’s opinion. Obviously this can literally have no other significant meaning behind it but I just know it honestly. The reason why I’m just so lost rn is because one of my sisters is Bi and I feel like another one is Bi as well but hasn’t said anything. Me being the only guy in my family and having gay people in my family, well others are just going to assume that I’m gay or something and I think it’s degrading and messed up because I’ve always been the one getting picked on growing up and stuff. I don’t have a girlfriend ether so being surrounded by these thoughts just gets my head twisted with questions of what if I’m going to become gay because I don’t like girls like I do but only for the sexual attribute. It seems messed up but there never been a girl that’s made me genuinely happy. I haven’t even had an actual girlfriend before. So obviously I want to have that experience really bad so when a girl is actually interested in me I don’t know how to act and it’s so embarrassing. I don’t know how to really communicate with one.

I'm trying to calculated the Top 3 categories of tasks using DAX, the dataset get updated every 15 minutes, is there any function in DAX can calculate the count of rows between a datetime and current time.

Please take a look to the my dataset, I have the table bellow called Tasks.

&amp;#x200B;

[Dataset](https://preview.redd.it/1m6hcqzpxdz51.png?width=403&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=067945f49d9e97a922459fa4e797dda26dc8e828)

I have tried the DAX code bellow but it only calculate the TOP 3 on the current day and not by the last hour.

`TOP_3 = Calculate(COUNT(Tasks[id_task]),FILTER(Tasks,(DATEDIFF(Tasks[Start DateTime],TODAY(),HOUR)&lt;=1)))`

So need your guys help in cracking a solution. Thanks in advance.

You useless piece of shit. You absolute waste of space and air. You uneducated, ignorant, idiotic dumb swine, you’re an absolute embarrassment to humanity and all life as a whole. The magnitude of your failure just now is so indescribably massive that one hundred years into the future your name will be used as moniker of evil for heretics. Even if all of humanity put together their collective intelligence there is no conceivable way they could have thought up a way to fuck up on the unimaginable scale you just did. When Jesus died for our sins, he must not have seen the sacrilegious act we just witnessed you performing, because if he did he would have forsaken humanity long ago so that your birth may have never become reality. After you die, your skeleton will be displayed in a museum after being scientifically researched so that all future generations may learn not to generate your bone structure, because every tiny detail anyone may have in common with you degrades them to a useless piece of trash and a burden to society. No wonder your father questioned whether or not your were truly his son, for you'd have to not be a waste of carbon matter for anyone to love you like a family member. Your birth made it so that mankind is worse of in every way you can possibly imagine, and you have made it so that society can never really recover into a state of organization. Everything has forever fallen into a bewildering chaos, through which unrecognizable core, you can only find misfortune. I would say the apocalypse is upon us but this is merely the closest word humans have for the sheer scale of horror that is now reality. You have forever condemned everyone you love and know into an eternal state of suffering, worse than any human concept of hell. You are such an unholy being, that if you step within a one hundred foot radius of a holy place or a place that has ever been deemed important by anyone, your distorted sac religious soul will ruin whatever meaning it ever had beyond repair. You are an idiotic, shiteating, dumbass ape and no one has ever loved you. Rhodes Island would have been better off if you'd never joined us. You are a lying, backstabbing, cowardly useless piece of shit and I hate you with every single part of my being. Even this worlds finest writers and poets from throughout the ages could never hope to accurately describe the scale on which you just fucked up, and how incredibly idiotic you are. Anyone that believes in any religion out there should now realize that they have been wrong this entire time, for if divine beings were real, they would never have allowed a being such as you to stain the earth and this universe. In the future there will be horror stories made about you, with the scariest part of them being that the reader has to realize that such an indescribable monster actually exists, and that the horrific events from the movie have actually taken place in the same world that they live in right now. You are the absolute embodiment of everything that has ever been wrong on this earth, yet you manage to make it so that that is only a small part of the evil that is your being. Never in the history of mankind has there been anyone that could have predicted such an eldrich abomination, but here you are. It’s hard to believe that I am seeing such an incredible failure with my own eyes, but here I am, so unfortunately I cannot deny your existence. Even if I did my very best, my vocabulary is not able to describe the sheer magnitude of the idiotic mistake that is you. Even if time travel some day will be invented, there still would not be a single soul willing to go back in time to before this moment to fix history, because having to witness such incredible horrors if they failed would have to many mental and physical drawbacks that not even the bravest soul in history would be willing to risk it. I cannot imagine the pure dread your mother must have felt when she had to carry a baby for nine months and then giving birth to such a wretched monster as you. Not a single word of the incoherent, illogical rambling you may be wanting to do to defend yourself or apologize would ever be able to make up for what you just did. The countries of the world would have wanted to make laws preventing such a terrible event like this from ever happening again, but sadly this is not possible since your horrific actions just now have shattered every form of order this world once had, making concepts such as laws irrelevant. Right from the moment I first set my eyes on you I knew you were an absolute abomination of everything that is wrong with humanity. I was hoping I would have been able to prevent your evil from being released upon this world by tagging along and keeping my eye on you, but it is clear to me now that not even the greatest efforts would have been able to prevent a terrible event in this scale from occurring. You are the worst human being, or even just being in general, that I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing. Events like the infected plague apparently only happened with the goal of teaching humanity to survive such a horrible event as the one you just created, but not even mankind’s greatest trials were able to even slightly prepare anyone for the insufferable evil you have just created. If you ever had them, your children would be preemptively killed to protect this universe from the possibility of anyone in your bloodline being even half as bad as you are, except you will never be able to have children, because not a single human being will ever want to come within a hundred mile radius of you and anything you have ever touched. You are a colossal disappointment not only to your parents, but to your ancestors and entire bloodline. The disgusting mistake that you have just made is so incredibly terrible that everyone who would ever be to hear about it would spontaneously feel an indescribable mixture of immense anger, fear and anxiety that emotionally and physically they would never truly be the same ever again. The sheer scale of your mistake, if ever to be materialized, would not only surpass the size of the world, but it would reach far beyond the edges of the known, and almost certainly the unknown universe. I could sit here and write paragraphs, nay, books describing your immense failure, yet even if I were to dedicate my life to describing the reality of what has just gone down here, and I would spend every moment of it until my heart stops beating working as hard and efficiently as possible, yet there is not even a snowballs chance in hell that I would be able to come close to transcribing the absolute shitshow you have just released upon the world. You are an irresponsible, idiotic, disgusting, unloved, horrible excuse for a living being who’s soul contains less humanity than every ginger in history combined. The absolute disgust I feel when thinking about anything that has even a slight resemblance to anything that might have to do with you and your unholy actions is so incredibly great that when I am honest about it I think that even I do not posses a consciousness great enough to comprehend my own feelings about it. When people of Columbia fought to break free from Lungmen, countless soldiers fought and lost their lives in favor of a chance at a better future for their children, they did not give their lives to have you fuck the world up beyond repair to the degree that you are doing right now. Honestly, even when technology advances and studies on the subject become more and more accurate, I do not think humanity will ever truly be able to understand what your failure actually means for the universe. My hate for you and everything you stand for is so much deeper than the depths of Shambala that you could probably take the entire Lungmen population down there and back up around twenty million times before you would have sunk to the end of my hate, and honestly, I do not want to exaggerate, but I think that that insult was low balling it such a massive amount that all mountains in this world combined would not be able to stack up to this imprecise judgement in light of the fact that when being honest, my hate is almost certainly bottomless. There is no one in this world that has ever loved you, and especially after what you just did, no one will ever love you in the future either. There is no hope that your idiotic behavior and especially your crooked soul will ever change for the better, and in fact quite the opposite might be true. By making the mistake that you just did, you have shown me that you are so incredibly hopeless that you will only devolve into a more idiotic and wretched creature than you already are. The only possible way in which your future would be brighter than the black hole your existence currently is would exclusively be because there is absolutely no conceivable way that you would even be able to sink lower than the pathetic place your current failure has put you in. But than again, you are so incredibly abominable that you would probably be able to surpass the worst conceivable failure a living being could possibly make. You are so incredibly pathetic that you are honestly not worth any more of my words nor my time. Just remember that I will forever detest you for your failure and everything you stand for, and no matter what happens, I will never ever forgive you.

2020-11-15 11:44:59 : Looking for a suggestion for a decent gaming laptop, specifically for WoW (shadowlands)! : MatSciePhD : https://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/jukoby/looking_for_a_suggestion_for_a_decent_gaming/

Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:

***$1,200, United States***

Are you open to refurbs/used?

***No***

How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?

***Battery life not very important, I never unplug my laptop. Performance is very important to me, more specifically I’m looking for a laptop that has good thermals. My current laptop gets literally burning hot to the touch when I game. A laptop that is capable of operating at high performance but not catching my desk on fire is very important to me.***

How important is weight and thinness to you?

***Low priority, though if laptop is light, cherry on top.***

Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.

***Yes. 17 (+/- half an inch)***

Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.

***A LOT of gaming, also may do a decent amount of coding for projects related to my degree. Also might be using some chemical/materials modeling in the future. But, I primarily will be gaming.***

***I will be playing WoW and almost exclusively WoW***

If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?

***Will almost only be playing WoW, I’d love to play at the highest possible settings with 40-60 fps.***

Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?

***At least 1 TB of storage, and I REALLY want it to be entirely SSD. No touch screen. Keyboard not majorly important, just a functioning keyboard is fine for me.***

Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.

***I primarily will be using this for gaming, almost only WoW. If I do end up using it for some grad school stuff, it will likely just be basic things like excel and PowerPoint. Maybe some coding. But primarily I’m just concerned with getting a decent laptop for a high quality WoW experience.***

2020-11-15 11:45:35 : Working list of Original Xbox Games/OneX Enhanced/Resolution updates : v4f4n7 : https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxSeriesX/comments/jukojv/working_list_of_original_xbox_gamesonex/

Hello, is there any TRUE list of all Xbox Series X/OneX compatible games from previous generations with all the important atributes included altogether (resolution, Enhanced, 16:9 widescreen support etc.)? So far I have found few such lists but theyre either wrong or incomplete therefore of no use. Microsoft used to have quite good Store with filters and so but it wouldnt be MS if they didnt break what had been working fine. Now their filter is also wrong (Ninja Gaiden 2/SSX3 for example both have beautiful 4k60 graphics but on the official MS list there is no 4k support listed...).

 I for example need to know if KOTOR 1 and 2 and many other games have 4K and widescreen support (presumably yes and no) or if at least can be played in full HD which is acceptable or if they are not enhanced at all with old 720 res (ie.

2020-11-15 11:45:24 : Makeup Reorganized in CAS After Update : MissDesignDiva : https://www.reddit.com/r/Sims4/comments/jukohl/makeup_reorganized_in_cas_after_update/

So has anyone else noticed this when choosing the makeup for their sims, that everything is completely re-organized now. I'm very fortunate that I have nearly every pack, but now the wild makeup from Get to Work, Luxury Party, Vampires and Island Living are at the top of the makeup categories. It's all the wild bold makeup that I rarely use anyways.  
Also on the topic of CAS and how it's sorted, I feel like within the tops category it could be sorted better, the big thing to me is there are a few different bodysuits that came with various packs, and I love them but they're impossible to find. They need to be within the "tops" category but if they had their own sub category that would be ideal. To me Sweaters and Sweatshirts sub categories could be merged into one, they're functionally the same, only difference is sweaters is slightly more fancy than sweatshirts but essentially they're the same. This is also true for the bra Sub category within tops and the Swimsuit tops sub category, functionally they're basically the same. Just some thoughts I have and if a mod exists to make this happen and give bodysuits the sub category they need within tops that would be great or if someone skilled with making mods wants to make one, that would work too. Just annoys me when things are sorted weirdly. Like the bodysuit with the lace back that came from Backyard Stuff is beautiful but I rarely end up using it cause it's so hard to find, it just looks like a normal tank top the way it's currently sorted.

2020-11-15 11:46:35 : Best path to becoming a technical artist? : Tinkerbeee : https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/jukovs/best_path_to_becoming_a_technical_artist/

Hey! I’m 17 y/o from the UK and I’m really interested in the idea of becoming a technical artist but I’m not sure how to get there. I’m studying computing right now and my school hasn’t run art this year so I haven’t been able to choose it. However, art has always been a speciality of mine and I’m continuing to do it outside of school - both at home and in dedicated lessons provided by my local art college.
    
The best course I found in the UK is a “computer graphics” course from UEA. However, it has an ivy league rating and I’m not super confident I’ll be able to get into it. I don’t have uber confidence in myself academically (I’m decent, but...) and Covid’s affecting everyone’s academic progress. Also, the other subjects I’m learning aren’t immediately relevant to computer graphics.
    
I’ve dabbled in blender and it’s extremely rewarding and it’s lack of limitations extremely fascinating. I’m stronger artistically at the moment, but if I had to choose which subject to have qualifications in it’d be computing. I think a technical artist is the closest thing to an equilibrium between art and computing - even if it’s more so creating the tools to do said art.

I think I’m better suited becoming a 3d modeller and or animator at the moment but I don’t think it’s plausible because of the job security I want - which, I believe the more “technical” aspect of a technical artist provides (feel free to debunk me on this). However, the more I learn about the technical aspects of digital art the more interested I become. Still, I do have quite a lot to learn. 

I’m absolutely enthralled by VR if that means anything. I’m not actively studying maths but I believe it’s one of the things that comes more naturally to me. My computing course has an optional computer graphics unit that I will DEFINITELY do. And, I’m really pissed off by the lack of good animation apps on the iPad and part of me wants to resolve that (bit random, but…). Any knowledge about this career path would be welcomed! Especially on how to get into it.

2020-11-15 11:46:31 : Feeling shattered and confused : brokenyetalive : https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/jukouz/feeling_shattered_and_confused/

Throwaway account but writing this with tears. 

I'm 28 y/o M dating someone (35 F) since past few months. 

To begin with, I've been seeing this woman since 5 months and the way we started was by having a casual relationship with regular sex. At first, we both made sure that we don't catch feelings for each other, so wanted to keep it casual. 
I had a sense that she was sleeping with someone else but since it was casual, I didn't pay much attention to it. She had divorce a year and half ago and I've been quite empathetic towards her situation. I've always treated her with utmost care and respect. 

Fast forward to September, she revealed that she got one of the STDs and she wanted me to get tested. This is when I gotta know that she was juggling multiple partners(around 5) during the same time she was seeing me. I've always ensured about protection and expected the same from her. But she did do unprotected sex with others. I still gave her a benefit of doubt and asked her what she feels about the situation. She said she has feelings for me and the other ones are just to get distracted, so she doesn't catch feelings. We thought of breaking it off but I've asked her to be exclusive and continue a potential serious relationship. (My biggest mistake) 

All along this journey, she always wooed me with compliments on how cute and handsome I look. How she was sexually attracted to me. After every sexual encounter we had, she used to send me texts how awesome it felt. She expressed how much she loves me. 

By this time, I was already in deep with her. Until one day.. I had to face the real truth. She wasn't just juggling multiple partners but she has been doing sex recklessly and carelessly since past one year. To be honest, she has had 24 partners in just one and half year. She has an history of sleeping around without using protection and out of the body count she mentioned, she saw quite a few people more than once or twice. At times, she had preferences for ethnicities just to gain superficial pleasures. I connect sex and emotions but it was totally different for her. However, time to time, she used to tell me how much she loves me and how good the sex with me was. I spent a lot of money, time and effort to keep her happy. 

Love is blind, so I still kept going. I cut her some slack for not revealing truth by herself but all of this at once was too much to synthesize. She has been having extremely wild past and I caught her in the middle. She tried to convince me that she is a changed person. We have been having continuous discussions on how we can work this out. We have had sex multiple times every week and she said I've been the best sexual partner she has ever had. It felt good. 

I insisted her to get tested again and found out she caught another std. She said it didn't get tracked in the previous test and I believed her. Fast forward to this week, out of my own curiousity, I digged in more details about what she was doing with the other partners when she was with me. I found out that she used to explicitly send nudes to one of those and have had extremely vulgar conversations with others. With me, even though she didn't have conversations as such but we were little dirty. She always gave impression that I'm the first option she had. 


Discussions got heated up and I had to face the harsh truth. While she always convinced me that how much she is into me, how much she enjoyed sex with me( saying that I was the best she had) , she revealed that she kept me as a fallback option since the beginning. She said she faked certain things about how much sex was pleasurable with me and how I was the first preference. However, the truth is that she was seeking attention and sex with one of the other partners who supposedly had bigger penis. She said this on my face. She said she kept me going because I was the only who cared about her feelings and she liked it. She mentioned the sex was just good enough. She would prefer the other one over me but he just used her for sex and had cut the communication. The reason she got into serious relationship with me was because I was the only one who gave a damn about her feelings and has invested so much in her. She gaslighted me with a lot of stuff that hurt me to the core. She always lied about how I was the first preference when she was having multiple partners. But in reality, she said I was an option just for sex. She even humiliated me saying I'm not good looking enough. 

I feel extremely shattered and confused on what to believe and what not to. I was the only one to stick around and care about her. I've given her pleasure and love in all aspects. While I was leaving, she said that certain humiliations and insults were not actually true but she said them just to get rid of me. I don't understand anything. 


I've been hating people who say these cliches such as 'Never make a ho* a housewife', because I've always tried to find best among people and accept flaws. It costed me. 

 I'm good looking male who cares about people in general. But this humiliation is unbearable. I don't feel like seeing a woman again. I don't feel like dating anyone. I was just played all along. May be a life lesson or may be not. But this scar stays. 😔

2020-11-15 11:46:54 : Unpopular Opinion: Critical Ops needs to work on the base game more than the events. : ExpandDonk365 : https://www.reddit.com/r/CriticalOpsGame/comments/jukoz6/unpopular_opinion_critical_ops_needs_to_work_on/

All of what I say is just my opinion, I would like to discuss about it but respect my thoughts.

TL:DR  
The developers focuses on mediocre events which try and lure new people but not solidify on the game itself more.

Let me just say, I love this game. I came from countless hundreds of CS:GO and TF2 because I just play a lot of that and I decided to play this as well when I got my iPad Pro 2018.  I've only had this game for 2 years so I can't really comment on how this game was previously but can at least give my thoughts.

The game lured me in due to its similarity of CS:GO and actually being a robust shooter in a time where mobile-gaming was frowned upon. However, the more I played, the more I invited my friends to play and as a result, we all play this game whenever we get the chance to.

&amp;#x200B;

But... I don't like where the developers put their priorities.

  
I can't exactly see what the developers focus on but from what the games updates have been about, I see a pretty big trend of releasing 1 gameplay update (view-model change, map changes) and releasing another event straight after, trying to cash in the mobile market and not trying to actively change areas of the game which needs it.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me say though, they've definitely been better but still, they should work on some places.

  
The lack of customizability always annoyed me whenever I try to suit my playstyle more to my preferences. Can I have my gun on the left side of my screen? nah. Can I remove the border of my crosshair? Nah. At least change the colour of the crosshair or type? (circle, dot etc) no. Can I at least vote-kick my AFK teammates or a cheater on my team?

n o.

Features such as a vote-kick menu, a proper ranked-matchmaking (I know everyone complains about, its not ***BAD***, just ***DISSAPOINTING*** sometimes), more game-mode selections in customs such as man-hunt, maybe a 1v1 game mode

&amp;#x200B;

And if you are going to change things such as our view-models or a (pretty-old) winners screen, at least give the player the ability to turn that SH\*T OFF CAUSE IT TAKES A YEAR FOR THE MENU TO END.

&amp;#x200B;

Critical Force definitely have added things such as server-commands and ability to change the hitmarkers sizes or damage-indicators but what about having a separate opacity slider for your ammo which makes pro-players look like clowns when they drop their weapon, in anticipation of a gun having more than 0 bullets.

 

This was more of a rant post, just trying to suggest my thoughts of the game. Thanks for reading.

In Silvergrove, the little kids’ father has the exact same face and voice as your father from your dreams. Your character even points this out when they first meet. I don’t really understand this. At first I thought it might be a hint that the place was an illusion, but it turns out that it was real after all. Is it meant to be a clue that your memories were fabricated by the High Ones, and that they simply took the child’s memory of his father and transplanted it into you? But then, why do you see the father in your very first dream, before the Ship sinks and the High Ones resurrect you? I don’t really understand what the story was doing here.

2020-11-15 11:47:45 : AskReddit shouldn't have removed the "ask a r*pist) thread back in 2012 : OfficialMarkZuck : https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/jukp9u/askreddit_shouldnt_have_removed_the_ask_a_rpist/

For those who don't know about this, back in mid-2012, on AskReddit, there was a thread that was essentially "ask a r\*pist". Many r\*pists shared their stories, and there was a lot of very interesting discussion on it. Sadly, however, the entire thread and all the comments in it got entirely nuked, which was a major loss.

Yes, I know it's a horrible thing that can be triggering to many, but still, it was a rare chance for honest discussion of a taboo topic. They should have just removed any comments that encouraged r\*pe, and left the thread alone. 

* The thread was used for research in multiple studies
* The thread gave a rare opportunity to hear the other side of the story

Then some psychiatrist made a thread calling it dangerous, based on what he admitted were theories that had never been tested, despite the fact that many r\*pe victims and advocates, including Gloria Allred and Jezebel, thought that the thread was a valuable thing.

It's probably too late to restore it now, but just some food for thought.

2020-11-15 11:47:59 : When is the best time to start submitting papers for big conferences (like, APA or CPA?) : Delicious_Swing8509 : https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/jukpcj/when_is_the_best_time_to_start_submitting_papers/

Hi all,

Hope my post is within the guidelines of the subreddit. 

I am a master's student in philosophy and considering writing some papers for conferences, so I was wondering when I should begin sending my papers to conferences, especially big ones. (I am not sure which conferences fall under the category of "big conferences" either, so I also welcome any recommendation or information you give to me.)

To be more specific, my questions are as follows:

(1) I was wondering if it is really important to impress someone at a conference, and if that means I should wait and polish my paper until I give a perfect talk at those major conferences, rather than giving a less perfect talk and developing my paper afterward. How much impact do presentations have on my career?

(2) In which stage of graduate years are students encouraged to send their papers? Is it even encouraged for undergrads or MA students to submit their papers to the conferences, if possible?

Thanks in advance!

i found a subdomain that redirects you to a gitlab login page (maybe after gitlab authentication you get redirected to internal stuff) and upon injecting X-Forwarded-Host: [evil.com](https://evil.com) the request gets redirected to [http://evil.com/users/signin](http://evil.com/users/signin) , but there's a header in the response that says Cache-Control : no-cache, in MDN it says  The response may be stored by *any* cache, even if the response is normally non-cacheable. However, the stored response MUST *always* go through validation with the origin server first before using it, should i report this as it may get cached ? im afraid they may say its validated first so it an N/A.

2020-11-15 11:49:12 : Can the hiring manager really ask you to share proof of your current salary? : parrot_fever : https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/jukpry/can_the_hiring_manager_really_ask_you_to_share/

I was just filling in an online job application, and one of the questions was about my current salary. It was a required field with dropdown options so I couldn't just skip it or write something else.  It also said **"You may be requested to provide proof of your current salary".** 

Is this even legal in Australia to ask a candidate to share proof of their current salary in a job application? I understand that this question often comes up later in the hiring process, but I think you shouldn't be obligated to share this information. I was so put off that I decided not to proceed with the application. I am not originally from Australia, so maybe it's the norm here and I am the one being unreasonable?

1. Looking for a good book on decision making/choices. I find it hard to make decisions when there are tons of other great options out there. It can get frustrating

2. Secondly i would like some other books as good as (not the same storyline) educated by tara westover, outliers by malcom gladwell and stoner by john williams. I really enjoyed those!

3. Lastly i would love some rudimentary book i can educate myself on world history events, philosophy &amp;  economics.

Hi Everyone - we just got the LR3 connect refurbished. I’m so excited. I think our cat has taken to it pretty easily. I wanted to know from current owners - what are some tasks associated with the LR to ensure that it’s clean, being used properly, a good poop experience for the kitty? Like how often do you change the filter, how often do you do a deep clean, how do you do a deep clean? How do you contain smell? Is there a smell problem (so far we are doing great on smell as in there is none lol - we use Dr. Elsey’s litter). 

Also - we got the scratch pad ramp and litter catcher - it’s good but it’s actually quite small and there is liter falling on the sides. We used to have a litter trap mat for our old standard box but I found those to be so annoying to clean. Are litter trap mats the best option or is there something else I can use? Something easy to vacuum up?

\- The idea that with the Ghost Experience activated you can only order your vehicles purchased at the Erewhon bivouac is wrong, so I think we need a way to order our vehicles with the Ghost Experience activated, and this would be by taking out a radio. open a menu, ask for your vehicle and the dialogs would be something like: "I send the vehicle to your location" - "Received". But this time with the novelty that you can choose the location of the delivery with a wheel like the one to make the AI companions move.

\- Improve stealth at night making it possible to turn off more lights by firing them, it is very stressful that you are with stealth turning off the lights and have some indestructible light.

\- Change that in the Ghost Experience you can only see the map when you get on a vehicle (it is a silly but important detail).

\- Make that the IA can do takedowns

\- PVP mode needs a lot of content

So you’ve completed your education and landed your job, you’ve found a girl that you’re content with, you’ve bought some real estate and your economy is good (I.e enough to buy what you want, but not enough to break free from the chains of society). Your first kid is on the way, all according to the “plan”.  You’re fit and healthy and you’ve started to save for your pension and kids future and bla bla bla. You’ve slowly but surely settled all your (most unrealistic) dreams from your teens/20s. My point is: you’ve done and achieved all that society and your parents raised you to do. 

My problem right now, then. is what now? All your life you’ve been goal oriented, such as competitions in sport, dating (winning the girl), grades in school, being the cool kid in class etc etc. But what is the goals going forward when you’ve been goal oriented all your life, and all the sudden you just can’t find any more goals, or none of your goals make sense anymore. 

Any reflections, tips, specific suggestions or whatever is warmly welcomed. Or maybe even just a thumbs up to appreciate that there’s more people in the same boat.

Hi guys, I'm looking to change my super from Rest Core Strategy to a low fee index fund or VDHG-like allocation. Current portfolio is not doing well thanks to COVID &amp; it's got me looking at changing to a Aus/International share growth option. I also currently salary sacrifice a small amount each fortnight.

Trying to decide between: Rest indexed shares, Sunsuper (Vanguard ties), Host plus indexed shares or Aus Super (reputable fund).

Since the funds don't really show long term performance, I'm not sure how to choose apart from basing it off fees? I know Vanguard is also looking into the superannuation space as well, but it could be a while...

Anyone currently with these funds able to shed some light on their pros &amp; cons?

2020-11-15 11:50:52 : [General Sci-Fi] Which Starship would you choose if you would travel in-between Universes/ Worlds? : cyberloki : https://www.reddit.com/r/AskScienceFiction/comments/jukqf4/general_scifi_which_starship_would_you_choose_if/

**How i came up with the Question:** So at first this sounds a little strange i know, the idea is basically that of a Multiverse like Marvel, StarTrek and others established. In the Show "Sliders" they travel in between parallel worlds which can be very similar but also way different than their original World. StarTrek has a few incidences of traveling into other universes like for example the mirror Universe. 

**So i was Wondering:** If i was to get lost in the Multiverse and somehow could achieve the Ability or Technology to jump controlled into the next world but were not able to directly go back to my original world because i didn't knew its Signature. And i somehow would end up at the right time in the right place to take command over any Starship i wanted. **Which of the many Sci-Fi starships i know, would i take as a home to explore the Multiverse further and maybe someday find my birth World again?**

**Would i take:**

* a small but fast ship for only one up to 4 persons like the Milleniumfalcon? 
* a slightly bigger ship like the Firefly?
* Would it be important to have weapons or a stealthmode like the Normandy (Masseffect) 
* How big should it be at maximum? Would for example the Normandy SR2 be too big already? 
* How about fuel supply? For the ship to function for longer it would need to be somewhat self-sufficient. Or use a type of fuel which one can find easy and in most universes. Soo, maybe a ship from StarTrek? But the Dilithium could become a problem also the minimal Crew one would need to operate it. On the other hand they have Replicators which would be a great luxury. 
* What amenities would the ship need to ensure my psychological health? Or to get a Crew to actually wanting to come with me so i am not alone anymore? In that maybe a bigger ship is better?
* how important is it to being able to land the Starship?
* That i am not alone and to help me operate the ship would an AI be an Idea? So maybe the Andromeda Ascendant? She can be operated by a minimal crew, is luxurious and self sustaining if there is a gas-giant to be found. Also one of the AI's surviving the downfall of the Commonwealth could maybe be convinced to help me if i rescue it somehow?
* How modifiable would the ship need to be to incorporate useful tech i find?  

**So what would you think? Do you know a ship that is so adjustable or homey that you would choose it without a doubt? What do you think would be the most important feature the ship should have for sure? Would you just choose the most potent for combat purpose or go more in the Stealthy peaceful direction and try to limit the influence you have on the worlds as far as possible?**

2020-11-15 11:51:30 : Firm mattress recommendation : miss-muffet-ca : https://www.reddit.com/r/IKEA/comments/jukqof/firm_mattress_recommendation/

I have a morgedal firm which I really like. But in less than three years, it's very compressed in the part that the body lies on. The indentations are clearly visible. 

I want to upgrade - which firm model should I consider next? I bought the morgedal before I know about foam or inner springs, and to be honest, I still don't think I understand the functional differences. All I know is I hate memory foam because in my experience they list firmness fault sickly and within three months I'd sink in a lot.  

Are the more expensive models within the fish or inner spring category just thicker mattresses, or are there other aspects like longer life?

And not the sort of art that involves things like Flesh/Gut Gardens or tortured and dying human bodies or ruined human minds

Instead they spend their time doing frankly disturbingly beautiful, literature, caligraphy and intricate music, sculptors, paintings, poems, architecture and smithing that gives a feel of....”something’s wrong here”

With the most obvious being scenes straight from Berserk

Say this “tradition” started a number of centuries before Aegon’s Conquest due to a Bolton Ward in Winterfell deciding he has to better “fit in” and discovered how surprisingly easy it was to channel said evil into ART that freaks some people out

Hi everyone, I don't know if this is the right place to ask these kinds of questions but we might as well try.

Specifically, each of the 4 applications runs on a docker container. All containers are connected to the same bridge network. Unfortunately the MongoDB exporter is unable to communicate with the database but I cannot understand why. I am using the Percona-maintained exporter by adding the MongoDB URI manually to the docker file as a global variable.

    ENV MONGODB_URI="mongodb://10.0.100.13:27017"

Unfortunately this doesn't seem to work. Using the curl command from a container in the same network to see the metrics collected by the exporter this doesn't seem to see MongoDB active 

    curl http://10.0.100.11:9216/metrics

The MongoDB authentication settings are the default settings and are therefore disabled.

Has this problem happened to someone who can show me a possible way to solve it?

We live in Queensland Australia and this is our very first time raising a flock of chickens. We have 29 birds. We had hoped to raise them as medication free as possible as some of them will be layers and some meat birds. We are now around 5 weeks in and the birds are growing up fast. So far we have raised them on non-medicated food. As time goes on, more and more people mention coccidiosis. We are concerned about treating the birds as we don't want to consume antibiotics etc from treatment. What is the best treatment option for our scenario? Any input is welcome.

The pillar of our community is respect and trust, we want to stay in a no-drama zone. We treat our server as a place to join and relax after a day at work/school. For recent Halloween, we worked together to create a huge mansion with a spooky rail and exploration game for our members, and now we are in process of building the Xmas District. We have a general "spawn" area with dedicated space for shops (quite a few of them already!!), community buildings, and freshly stated Games District. There is plenty of things to be done still! We are not planning on the world restart until 1.17 comes out as we are not focusing on riches.

Positive people that understand our point of view on the game and want to share good moments with us.

This is a forum for project self-reflection identification of weaknesses and formation of solutions to drive positive change for the protocol. Concerns raised may focus on:

* Protocol design or technicals
* Areas requiring further research
* Economics or market infrastructure
* Marketing or community development

This initiative is a valuable culture to identify and manage the risks, challenges and uncertainties faced by the Decred project. Changing the world is hard, doing it well even more so.

[The Decred Falcon escaping chaos due to regular and constructive self-reflection \(circa. 2142\) ](https://preview.redd.it/vu2jl91b7ez51.png?width=1394&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=654425dedcaf9e9dd7de1308407addc0febe2d44)

# Ground Rules

1. Building Decred is Hard. Please do not forget we are at the cutting edge of technology and social change and it takes immense time, skill, money and effort to deliver this project. Please comment accordingly.
2. Solutions or Considered Options should be presented alongside commentary of areas for improvement. Complaints are easy, solutions are hard. If you are not sure of a solution, that is ok, bring up the discussion and make an effort to seek an answer. Unproductive complaints without solutions are discouraged.
3. Be Respectful of readers, comments and critiques. Decred is an open source protocol where no one person is in charge. The primary objective of this initiative is to identify concerns and address them constructively. All holders of DCR are responsible for project outcomes and we get out what we put in.
4. Review past editions and don't hammer on repeated issues. Many issues take time to solve and concerns raised repeatedly have likely been heard. It is ok to return if progress does not appear to have be made
5. Utilise Up/Downvotes to Identify priority concerns. The biggest issues should rise to the top to ensure maximum attention.

2020-11-15 11:53:20 : Friendly Advice regarding Buses and HGVs : PRev45 : https://www.reddit.com/r/cycling/comments/jukrby/friendly_advice_regarding_buses_and_hgvs/

Hi! 
Bus driver here.
As I'm sure too many of you are unfortunately aware that sometimes bus drivers/HGV drivers and cyclists come together on the road in a dangerous and unhealthy fashion. Particularly in built up area's.  I would like to help bring this number down. 

 As drivers we are given many tips and training on how to avoid these situations ; and (although there are always idiots no matter what vehicle) we do try to follow these and look out for you as best we can. Unfortunately ,there are many road users of all creeds that need to do better.

That said there seems to be a distinct lack of resources for cyclists to see what it is like in a large vehicle , which is a shame. It's so much easier to be courteous to a cyclist when you can see their perspective but not many cyclists I have spoken to have ever had the opportunity to experience driving a large vehicle or experience just how well a cyclist can hide in mirrors. 

This video for a HGV should help demonstrate( https://youtu.be/lV-rhiGRFTE ) 

So I thought I would give you a list of tips to help keep yourselves safe! I am sure many of you know these already but it may be helpful to new people or casual cyclists. 

• Dress brightly preferably in high visibility clothing 

• Hang back behind buses or lorries at roundabouts or junctions , this is because we may not take the path you expect when manoeuvring. 

•NEVER go up the left hand side between bus/lorry and the curb. (Right hand in america) We may not see you in mirror checks and it's a pinch point where space will rapidly close. 

• If a bus looks likely to pull away from a stop or is indicating to do so DO NOT overtake. This is because you may have been in the rear blindspot during our mirror checks , in the split second we are checking over our other mirror or are making sure no public are about to be injured as we pull away you could be struck by the front as the Bus / Lorry pulls out. 

• Even in the day use lights 

•Try to signal with your arms as clearly as possible and slightly earlier if a bus is following. These vehicles are heavy and a bus has the most precious cargo of all. Sudden stopping of a cyclist to make a turn or a misleading signal can lead to many injuries for both parties. 

• Try not to sit in the blindspot to the rear of the bus, we can't make provisions for your safety if we are unaware you are near us .

• Use cycle lanes where possible , but beware of ones that cross junctions. 

•Watch out for the mirrors when filtering! Nobody likes a headache :) 

Thank you for reading! I'm tired at the moment so I may have missed a few feel free to add them below. If I think of any I will add them. 

Hopefully we can make the road a safer place. Cycle safe!

Hello, I decided I want to move out from Germany and live back in the USA. I wanted to live back with my sister so I can stay with her and also help her with her 4 kids. I have an American passport because I used to live there for maybe 10 years or so but I don't have a green card. From education wise before I left America I was in the 6th Grade and from then on I was in the German School and I finished my apprenticeship there as a machine Operator (making cable and wires) and worked there for a good 7 years. Now I work at a construction site (changed career because I didn't like working shifts anymore) hoping to get some plus points on my curriculum vitae (CV). 

I only want to go there if I am certain I can get a job there, So how can I apply for a green card or is there also any other requirements that I need?

Thanks in advance.

2020-11-15 11:54:04 : Trying to understand Modular Entropy Multiplication &amp; Questions about implementation : nonchip : https://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectronics/comments/jukrml/trying_to_understand_modular_entropy/

# Background

"Modular Entropy Multiplication" is a "true random number generation" concept where a noise source (in most implementations the thermal noise inside the "multiplication" stage itself) is amplified using a "multiplication with modulo" stage, which has the benefit of making many attacks nonviable (such as trying to bias the noise source using EM interference, which will actually be turned into just another noise source).

according to [openrandom](http://www.openrandom.org/resources/thermal/how_it_works.md), [redoubler](https://github.com/alwynallan/redoubler) and [infnoise](https://github.com/waywardgeek/infnoise) this happens by building a circuit which:

* multiplies a held analog voltage using an op-amp (this introduces a small amount of thermal noise) and outputting that as a bit of entropy
* then biases that held voltage using a comparator to make sure an attacker or insufficiently tuned circuit can't just force it to "cling" to the rails.
* then holds that resulting voltage (for input in the next clock cycle)

# Schematics research so far

I've found 2 schematics so far which i seem to kinda understand:

## Redoubler
![redoubler schematic](https://github.com/alwynallan/redoubler/raw/master/images/MEM_Circuit.png?raw=true) 
This seems to be 2 of the "stages" described above feeding into each other.

## Infnoise-small
![infnoise-small](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/waywardgeek/infnoise/master/infnoise_small/schematic.png)

This seems to be a single stage. this is not actually the infnoise design from what i can tell (the [actual device](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/waywardgeek/infnoise/master/images/infnoise.png) seems to use the same 2-stage setup the redoubler does and gets its various clock signals bit-banged via USB), but a simplified single-stage setup for simulation purposes.

# Questions

* Why do people use a 2-stage setup? is that just so you always have a bit of entropy available no matter which half-cycle the clock is currently in, effectively doubling the output bitrate, or does it actually improve the entropy somehow?

* How would one implement (using readily available more or less discrete components, more like the infnoise, not a CPLD like the redoubler or openrandom does) the "switches" in the above schematics? all actual implementations i can think of would mess with the voltages in some way, wouldn't this matter? (semi-answered by infnoise using [this](https://www.onsemi.com/pub/Collateral/MC74VHC1G66-D.PDF) one, but that still must have *some* effect?) can anyone explain to me why it *wouldn't* matter as much as i think?

* why does the [actual](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/waywardgeek/infnoise/master/images/infnoise.png) infnoise implementation require 2 separate "switch enable" signals? as far as i can see every other schematic only uses a single clock signal (and sometimes its inverse, which could be achieved by simply swapping the switch inputs around)

* Especially looking to get a low-cost, low-pcb-real-estate, low-chipcount implementation one could just "drop in" to another design, how viable would a "single stage" (built according to half of the redoubler schematic) setup with something like a [triple rail-to-rail opamp](analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/ADA4855-3.pdf) and the [switch above](https://www.onsemi.com/pub/Collateral/MC74VHC1G66-D.PDF) be? why does the redoubler schematic seem to require just one cap and 2 resistors per stage, but the infnoise-"small" so many more passives?

2020-11-15 11:54:26 : UPDATE - Dad (M58) &amp; whole family - confirmed positive : NoUICU : https://www.reddit.com/r/covidpositive/comments/jukrsd/update_dad_m58_whole_family_confirmed_positive/

Hello again,

I'm coming back to report our disease timeline. I posted here 17 days ago when my dad got sick. In the meantime, all of us managed to catch Covid from him, and all of us had different symptoms. 

My dad is fine now, it has been a week since his last fever. He is still quite tired, but he feels better with each day. He went to the hospital on day 11 and they found a small shadow on his upper left lung; otherwise, he was completely alright. He had an appetite through and through. He did get depressed after a while, but it was more situational than a symptom of Covid - he hates being bed-bound. He got prescribed another antibiotic in the hospital to target whatever is in his lungs. He also took dexamethasone on day 10 for four days to staunch the inflammation. 

My mother (56) is still experiencing low-grade fevers during the evenings, but she got sick approximately a week after my dad developed symptoms, so she is bound to kick it in a few days. She had horrible headaches that made her throw up, nausea, back pains, general malaise, distorted sense of smell and taste, as well as night sweats. She went to the hospital a few days ago, and she was so weak that she couldn't dress herself without taking intermittent breaks. She had to get an IV because she was dehydrated (she couldn't eat due to nausea). She has the same small shadow in her upper left lung, just like my dad had. She is now taking dexamethasone (day 4), baby aspirin, and an antibiotic. She is feeling much better since she went to the hospital. I hope her recovery will continue in this direction. 

I (28) had the mildest disease - I woke up during my first night with a low-grade fever and a headache. Afterward, when I woke up in the morning, I was so nauseous that I vomited. I was feeling a lot better once I threw up the five cups of tea I managed to down before I went to sleep - my headache abated, as well as my nausea. I had low-grade fevers, nausea, heartburn, a runny nose, and headaches for four or five days, and then it just went away. I did lose my sense of smell and taste, but it returned as quickly as it went away. It's been a week and a half since, and I have not had any relapses or recurring symptoms (for now, fingers crossed). I have been on a steady regime of vitamin D, C, and Zinc for at least a couple of months. I have no idea if this helped anything.   

My brother (25) is fine as well. He had headaches, body aches, loss of smell and taste, a runny nose, nausea, and malaise for about a week and now he is fine. He does get fatigued easily, but he is getting better with each day. He also took various vitamins with me, but he still had different symptoms than I did. His sense of taste and smell is coming back (day 18).   

We are taking our time and pacing ourselves to ensure that we recover as well as possible. We have been told by a virologist that these viruses can completely mess up a person for months on end, and rest is the best thing you can do for yourself in these situations. I know many cannot afford to do this and I hope that we will get better treatment for this thing as soon as possible.  

My heart goes out to everyone going through this or has lost a loved one to this virus.

2020-11-15 11:54:24 : possible long distance... confusion? (I have no label on it) fm 21&amp;m 22 : ocboundd : https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/jukrrq/possible_long_distance_confusion_i_have_no_label/

im definitely asking and posting on here as a long shot but here goes nothing..

im a fm (21) and the guy that i actually met was on twitch (22). we started conversing when my ex first broke up with me for 2 weeks, then we got back together. Although twitch guy was just a friend until collectively my friend and I decided to take a trip to Palm Springs for Halloween (where i decided on my own that the relationship between my ex and I was unhealthy and we broke up again for good) and i invited twitch guy and if he wanted to bring a friend (which he did) \*disclaimer: we're all covid safe\*. Before we all went he did mention in text that he has no intentions of sleeping with me, he wanted to make that clear, but if something happened he absolutely wouldn't be upset over it happening and wouldn't stop it because i have maybe told him before that i wanted him to rail me while i was drunk lmfaooo

we ended up meeting after 3 months and we had a great Halloween weekend. When we got there, funny enough his friend thought he was going to get laid so his friend brought condoms (he told me this). First night twitch guy ended up getting head because his friend's condoms were in his friend's room and he couldnt get them because his friend was knocked out lol. Next night we actually slept together.

For the time period that my boyfriend and I were broken up twitch guy ended up making remarks that i was cute \*before meeting\* and we actually hit it off really well romantically. During the time of knowing each other we'd stay up all night texting, facetiming, snapchatting, etc. We just basically communicated for every single day for 3 months with absolute ease, nothing felt forced on either end.

So we obviously go back home from the weekend at palm springs and he's texting me all this cute stuff (saying how he'll visit me and how he misses me and being with me and kissing me and how he hopes we have more moments together in the future and how im the first person in like 9 months that he's been with and he hasnt been seeking it) and its actually going well... then all of a sudden he pulls back and blames it on his mental health.

A week goes by and we stopped talking and I ended up just confronting him about what's going on because it felt like I was being ghosted and especially how vulnerable he knew i was (which i doubt any guy cares about but lol) after the break up and hooking up isnt my thing at all for myself.

He ended up telling me that long distance scares him and it wouldn't work out with his life and he wouldn't be able to drive to see me (we live roughly 4-5 hours away from each other) because his car actually isn't registered bc of his mods i believe (it's a real excuse he's mentioned it on his stream many times before) so driving 5 hours away wouldn't be feasible (his words). He also mentioned that hes still pretty traumatized about his past relationships (we actually initially bonded over the fact that his relationship was a toxic and unhealthy one just like mine and we had a lot of similarities and how he hasnt had very good luck with them since his i believe first ex (who he thought he was going to marry.. bought her a promise ring and everything)... they've been broken up for 3 years as far as i know) and that he'd still like to keep me as a friend. Which is cool and all i opted to stay friends because of course i'd rather keep him as a friend rather than completely cut him out.

Not gonna lie it hurts.. so a couple things i'm trying to figure out:

1. this may seem pretty obvious for most guys to figure out but for someone who's only been with one other person (me)... Was he just trying to hook up only? even despite everything he's said?
2. when addressing the whole long distance dating thing when he pulled back due to his mental health, he did mention that he wouldn't "discredit the idea of dating, but right now just isn't the time"... is that just an easy way of turning me down?
3. Our friendship kinda just fell off the rails and now we don't even talk anymore and it actually kind of sucks... even without the expectation of a relationship I still missed talking to him and knowing how his day was or hearing about how he got stupid excited over a bagel at 3am lol or making jokes on facetime or while playing video games. it almost feels like we're not even friends anymore. is there any way to fix this
4. im very tempted to make him a long distance hook up/fwb mainly because we both enjoy the same things sexually and even if i did make the drive to see him we could still just hang out as friends and we'd be chill
5. not that im trying to force it but do you think this is a possibility that this will ever grow into something more potentially? as frickin whack as it sounds... this is definitely a guy i could see potentially being with in the future and i really enjoy his presence
6. also is he really that traumatized by his first ex/love??? i mean... it's been 3 years and if he's really keeping himself this guarded he's never going to be happy not just romantically but with himself if he keeps himself from possible opportunities not just with me but with anyone (because of course i'd love to see this guy happy even if it isn't with me)

2020-11-15 11:54:44 : Building a dual system desktop with a budget between 0 and 10000 : tmjrs : https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/jukrwk/building_a_dual_system_desktop_with_a_budget/

Hi reddit,

Been here for years but finally decided to make an account due to the subject I have been breaking my head about. The goal is simple, build a dual system (Windows / Qubes) which preferable is in one case.   


The Windows will require a GPU for gaming on an 5220x1440 screen with an additional screen probably coming up next year. For the Qbues I originally had an integrated GPU in mind but that is open for discussion of course.   


Both systems need to be able to run at the same moment and I have 0 experience with water cooling. Then again we are never to old to learn so if there are valid reasons I will happily consider it.

Regarding basic hardware I think at this moment zen3 with 4000mhz memory is the basis I am looking at. I have been with Intel for years but looking at the current state of the CPU market I think there is little doubt about that choice. 

For the GPU I originally planned for the 3090 series but due to the scalping/prices at this moment I am waiting on the 6900 benchmarks. 

In the last month I have made over 50 configurations with minor modifications and it is driving me nuts. Like said in the title is the budget basically what I make from it but I am looking for a sane bang for bucks configuration. 

Plan is to keep the system for 3 to 4 years and RGB is not needed for me at all.  
I kept the questions quite open on purpose because I am curious for your views on this.  


For each person who red and thought about this, thanks in advance.

Kind regards,

tmjrs

[WeWantOut] 37M &amp; 37F USA -&gt; Italy

Hello. I’m new here so please bear with me. I have just recently acquired my dual citizenship with Italy. My wife and I would like to relocate to Italy permanently in the near future. She will eventually become a citizen as well (via marriage) but the needed time to do that is longer than we want to stay in the US. My questions are: 
- Is she eligible for health care coverage once she obtains the correct visas &amp; residence cards?
- Do any of those visas also allow her to work?
- Is their a work-around any of the permits or visas if I convert my American business to Italian business and lost her as a co-owner or employee? (I own an artist management company and can work remotely)

Summing up, i have pain on my shoulders, elbows, fingers, thigh connection with pelvis, knees and soles. Already went into orthopedists, rheumatologists, physiotherapists and nothing conclusive.

My best try still is the rheumatologist, but i am already hopeless. My exams are not conclusive, he discarded RA, now suspecting about fibromyalgia. This are my exams:

Rheumatoid factor: Positive one time, negative several times. When positive, very close to the acceptable value.

Anti-CCP test: Negative.

Ultrasound of shoulders and knees: Only the inflamed bursa, no wear of the joints.

Other general blood exams ok.

With all that my doctor just said me to wait. I am not sure if he just doesn't have the minimum ideia of what do i have or if he is afraid of give me a strong medication for his only guess remaining (Fibromyalgia).

I am so confused about my pain symptoms. It sounds like if i walk for a while it really increases my chances of pain on the lower joints, at same time that even in days on the bed this parts also hurts. My shoulders crack too much, there are some days on which i can't even raise my hand. Thanks god i am working from home and without any pressure, but it still sucks try to hide it from everyone to not hear "you're to young for thst" shit and etc.

Not sure what to expect with this post. I am just really sad about how my like is going with this condition and not even know what is is.

My medicines are Cetoprofen for the worst days (recently almost diary), dipyrone and ice packs.

2020-11-15 11:55:24 : Harpist new in the London music industry- advice? : wozzeckalbanberg : https://www.reddit.com/r/harp/comments/juks5t/harpist_new_in_the_london_music_industry_advice/

Hi!

I was wondering if anyone had any advice. I have recently been approached by a mutual friend to feature in an up and coming artist’s track. I recorded some harp and sent it over to the producer who will include some of it and now wants to set up some proper recording sessions once covid restrictions allow. I have been told I will be paid. However, I have no experience of the “music” industry - I have done live gigs at receptions, weddings etc and am familiar with these going rates and contracts but know nothing about dealing with producers and non-classical non-live music. I was told by a friend to be careful because it is a cut-throat industry and likely to try and fleece you at every corner. 

A bit about me: I am 22, not a full time harpist but did a music degree, so I have dedicated at least 16 years to my instrument. I have slipped a bit since as I have a full time job, but the money is not my motivation. However obviously I would like to have potentially more opportunities and need to know how to value what I have to offer. 

Any advice welcome. Thanks!

2020-11-15 11:56:06 : Switching to engineering after finishing a degree (Advice appreciated!) : BlueSofaChill : https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/jukseu/switching_to_engineering_after_finishing_a_degree/

Hey, everybody!

Hope you are doing well and not getting too overwhelmed with your coursework!

For the last year, I've been really dissatisfied, to put it mildly, over my choice of degree (law). I really dislike it, don't feel like I even got an aptitude for it nor can I imagine myself practicing law in the future, thus blaming myself for making the wrong choice, but I decided to move on and not drop out in the middle of it all. Now I am a third year aka final year 21 year old student.

Despite that, I know I have good skills in natural sciences and mathematics in IB, where I was on top of my class not so long ago. In addition, I've been doing computer programming for the 8 months and definitely have a good skill for it as well as finishing a Calculus-I course with an A, which I greatly enjoyed!

Recently, I've gotten a greater interest in engineering (especially chemical/biological engineering), and was thinking of continuing my education after graduating, but I am really unsure of how to move forward. Should I be applying to undergraduate programs or are there any like possibilities for people to switch into engineering who already have a degree?

Yours advice would be greatly appreciated and hope you stay safe in these turbulent times!

Hi. This will be a bit long but I really need some help. My boyfriend and I were dating for more than a year and we decided to tell my family about it. I love him and someday even plan to marry him. However my family simply refused to accept our relationship and forced me to break up with him. I did not but we are now secretly dating because my parents said that they'll stop funding my education if I start dating him again. Everything was alright for a while but I started noticed that my sister and brother who are both younger than us are treating my boyfriend really badly. Frankly they are acting like animals. My boyfriend was very upset over this and often fights with me too. I know what he is going through and it breaks my heart. I just can't figure out how to tell my bro and sis off with letting them know that I am still dating my boyfriend. Does anyone have any advise??

Welcome to the very last AFI survivor round! After several months, we are able to find out what is apparently AFI's greatest song, but we've nearly done the reverse as well. Coming in 3rd place in the worst of the worst survivor is...

**Crop Tub!**

Yeah, I'm not even going to try and make puns with this song. Let me be completely blunt here, I can't stand this song. I'm not big on Very Proud of Ya as a whole, but this song still manages to be among my least favourites on that album.

Well that means that it has come down to fellow Very Proud of Ya track Shatty Fatmas, and the legendary brilliance that is The Chicken Song. I honestly don't know what to expect, but I wouldn't be surprised if the results went either way.

2020-11-15 11:56:47 : EVERGLOW - LA DI DA : The song that got no time for haters : abc1234fuse : https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/juksnq/everglow_la_di_da_the_song_that_got_no_time_for/

**Note : These series of posts by me are just done casually for fun, I'm just an ordinary high school kpop fan like a lot of people, has totally no background in music or dancing, please take this post with a grain of salt and just take it as opinions that aren't meant to be taken seriously.**

[LA DI DA](https://youtu.be/jeI992mvlEY) is girl group Everglow's 4th release, comes with a mini album titled "-77.82 x - 78.29" which are apparently the coordinates of somewhere in Antartica. They have been using this number for several times, I suck at theories so I will not talk about that :(((((( let's jump into the song appreciation. 

The song starts with Sihyeon's verse as they should 😍 my bias rocked this comeback. The song then continues, there's nothing much to talk about, just some solid verses next to each other. The song gets way more interesting after this though. 

The pre-chorus utilizes Onda and Aisha's contrasting voice colors. And Onda finally has actual lines. LINES. 💃💃💃💃💃💃 Aisha's "don't bring me down down" also sounds very nice. And at the tail end of it we have the signature EVERGLOW pause with Yiren then the chorus comes and the magic happens. 

What I like about the retro trend aside from the concept itself, is that most songs that comes with, will have full, long extended vocal choruses. This time it comes with such a strong one too. The "la di da da di da" will always be stuck in my head. 

Next up we have Mia doing a little highnote before the song switches up to enter a new section which is E:U and Mia's verse, I personally don't like this part that much, I'm happy the song has several change ups to keep things interesting though, and the song quickly bounces back to the same again. And everything goes the same way as it does earlier, but this time we cancel that pause and just like Dun Dun we jump right into the chorus. 

What's new here is the bridge. We have a little disco(?) dance break with nice beats here, and Aisha just said "I don't give a what" haha. To make things even more interesting, the song switches up again during Yiren's part into something else. 

The chorus comes back, and there's another pause but in an unexpected place, right at the la di da hook. Then all the nice instrumentals come back again and even stronger with their adlibs. I wish the song continues forever because that is one damn perfect chorus. 

\_

What I love about the song is despite being just a retro comeback, the song goes through different changes several times throughout the song to keep it interesting and the song is FULL of memorable and catchy lines. 

This one is probably my most favourite "retro" (I hope I'm right this time) comeback out of all the releases these months. The song has retro sounds yet still manage to make it very dynamic throughout. I hope Everglow does return to this sound occasionally since it fits them so well. 

Also the dance is hard af. I read somewhere and they said some dance moves looks like physical therapy but x10 speed. Tons of complicated movements that really use your whole body. How did they do that 😳

I also really like the cyberpunk dystopian-future theme of the MV. 

Thank you for reading! If you spot any mistakes in the post like using the wrong terminologies please comment below and I will fix it.

hi moms,

usually i post on here as a sibling in the comments but i need a bit of help. i am recovering from depression that developed over around 3 years due to stress and loss of a few family members and pets. i first was blaming myself and feeling guilty as i never go to say a proper goodbye to any of the people i lost. i was self harming and planning suicide, i got over it with the help of my nephew who arrived in march this year. last year we bought a house and were planning to move in by about September at the latest, thanks to covid we have had a lot of issues with the builders and such and consequently we still haven't moved in and at earliest it will be complete by the new year. i have had a year of constant stress and it has been getting progressively worse, i have started to get better, i started writing things down and have found myself getting better. before covid my grandma had work done on her house and er fish had to be put under mine and my uncles care. i have 2 5 gals and 1 7.5 gal tank at the moment aas my 30 is in storage till in the new house. i looked after my albino cory and my grandmas sidthumunki (dwarf chain loach). my uncle, as he has a 40 gallon breeder took the other fish. a majority of these were the last things my grandad had ever bought me. we went to get my fish recently as the work had been completed and the covid rules had eased enough. when i went his tank had had no maintenance done for over a year. he still had a gibbiceps that should be in a 150 gal in a 40 and a huge amount of my fish were dead, including my old scwarzii cat who was almost as old as me, my upside down cat, and angel, my lacefin BN pleco. it completely destroyed me. he had already almost killed my koi (we didn't know until after he had the fish and covid appeared) and then went ahead and killed a huge amount of my fish. it equated to over £200 worth of fish and he claims that it was old age that got them and wont believe me about parameters and such. 

during the 15 min drive back to my grandmas we lost 3 out of the remaining 4 cardinals. lost our remaining molly who had been ill for months due to him and several other fish. we couldn't even acclimate the fish, we just threw them in the tank hoping the clean water would help. out of over 50 fish we sent to his we only have 6 survivors. 1 of which was his fish in the first place. i have developed trust issues from this i think and barely trust anymore than 3 people with anything. i know i shouldn't think that everyone is like my uncle but my fish are an integral part of my life, i dont know what id do without them and it has really affected me. this was over 3 months ago and i am still completely destroyed by it. our fish have recovered, we have got our other fish healthy, restocked our tanks and now have a trio of angels, various tetras and my cats but just cant get over what he did to fish that he didn't even own, and he wont own up to it. i have never greatly liked my uncle due to a few things that he has done but this has pushed me over the edge, and my sister proceeded to tell me that it was my fault for trusting him. i know i shouldn't turn to reddit for help i would just like to know that it wasn't my fault. i am aiming to get help from my school so i am in the process of getting things done for it.

This is all internal clients. However we did not have scrum master or product mgt title. It was project mgt title. Currently im in a diff job doing pure scrum master and want to pivot back to internal product mgr, what should I do with my previous job title on my resume at that bank?

2020-11-15 11:57:29 : [TOMT] [late 1990s] electronic gadget marketed to teens, was advertised during Buffy : ihatehemingwayclub : https://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/jukswi/tomt_late_1990s_electronic_gadget_marketed_to/

I've tried searching many different ways via Google and also tried watching compiled commercials on Youtube that ran on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" during that time period (that was the only place I saw it advertised, but it's possible it was advertised during other shows that targeted a teen audience at the time.) It was a gadget that allowed you to communicate with your friends who also had one of the gadgets. I'm not sure if it was similar to a walkie-talkie or similar to texting or both, nor what the range between the devices would have been. This was before cellphones were very common in the US and thus preceded texting. I am hoping to make reference to it in a piece of fiction set during that time period and want to make sure I have it right before I try writing that part of it. Thanks in advance.

2020-11-15 11:58:10 : Insecurities in friendship and relationship : Tweey : https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/jukt5p/insecurities_in_friendship_and_relationship/

I'm not really sure if this post fits within this subreddit, keep that in mind.

&amp;#x200B;

I \[20M\] have as long as I can remember had this insecurity of being left by my friends. I don't really talk with anyone about it, I have just gotten used to the feeling from time to other. Usually I get this feeling when I'm by myself and alone, and they are often irrational thought where I look for signs they gave for them to leave me. I usually write them down, and when I look at them in retrospect they are often very irrational, but they always feel very real and it hurts very bad when I'm in this "period". They rarely last more than 24h, and I might get these thoughts once or twice a week. Sometimes it's worst than others

2 months ago I got my first girlfriend and I'm generally very excited whenever I see her, however we both are busy as students and we mostly see eachother in the weekends. We have been communicating very well and I've told her about my "fear", and she really wanted me to tell her whenever I got these thoughts next and at first I felt reassured it would be "easy" the next time. Well, it wasn't. On thursday I was sure she was about to leave me, and I could barely sleep just imagining a future without her. I did not manage to tell her, she had a good day and I didn't want to bother her and i was sure she was about to leave me either way. Whenever these thought get really bad I've gotten into the habit of SH, becasue it sorta helps me (Kinda hard to explain how). She knows about this aswell, and whenever we talk she is really supportive. I saw her again yesterday, and everything felt at peace again. It felt natural and I was happy, she seemed happy however I did not bring myself to bring up thursday.

&amp;#x200B;

However I'm not sure how many of these episodes I'm able to manage. They are mentally exhausting and I feel broken beyond repair, but I always manage to stabilize somehow. I'm scared what will happen if I talk to her while these thoughts are at their worst. I've almost called her to break up, because I'm convinced she will break up with me but I'm sure I will regret it, because I really love her.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if this post comes up as sort of rambling, but if anyone had any similar thoughts or experiences; please share. Is there any way I can communicate "better" with her because whenever we are together everything is great and I don't want to lose her.

Rugul ignoranței noastre...         
O vorbă veche din bătrâni spune că deșteptul învață din greșelile altora iar prostul nu învață nici din ale lui...  
Suntem la al doilea incident major, în care un incendiu a luat viața unor pacienți. Și unde asta? În spitale, în acele locuri în care se duce un război pentru viață, nu împotriva ei. Și se pare că nu învățăm nimic din greșelile noastre. Și nu învățăm, și nu venim cu soluții pentru că suntem într-un punct în care nu ne mai poate salva o singură măsură. Oricât de radicală, genială, sau inovativă ar fi ea.  
Nu, dramele de tot felul nu se vor opri după ce președintele, prim-ministrul sau miniștri vor fi numai oameni inteligenți, educați solid și mai ales bine-intenționați. Nu, nici atunci. Nici dacă am prelua un întreg pachet de legi care în alte țări a dus la prosperitate și pace socială, nici atunci lucrurile nu se vor schimba. Pentru că ai avea nevoie de polițiști care să creadă în acele legi suficient de mult încât să le aplice și de cetățeni care să creadă în ele suficient de mult încât să le respecte.  
Și mai ales, am avea nevoie de oameni care sunt educați altfel decât cei de acum. Oameni care au învățat înțelegând, nu oameni care au învățat repetând. Oameni care au învățat întrebând, oameni care încă nu au aflat că "nu poți să schimbi nimic"  
Ar mai fi nevoie și de cetățeni care să fie independenți. Care să nu aibă nevoie de mila statului, de bunăvoința unui potențat local, oameni care știu că politicienii trebuie sa fie în slujba lor și nu invers.   
Am avea nevoie de oameni care își prețuiesc așa de mult mândria profesională încât nu și-ar vinde-o oricât de mare este șpaga. Am avea nevoie de toate cele de mai sus, și de multe, multe altele.   
Și va spun asta nu fiindcă vreau sa va descurajez. Nu, pentru că procesul de schimbare al societății noastre în direcția cea bună a început. De mult. Doar că se mișcă greu. Vă spun toate astea pentru că nu vreau să văd oameni care abandonează  lupta pentru că au crezut că acea scurtă bătălie poate rezolva tot. Vă spun asta pentru că vreau să înțelegeți că nu avem de-a face cu o bătălie, ci cu un război. Unul de o sută de ani. Unul care se întinde pe generații.   
   Și va spun asta mai ales ca să repet ce putem face fiecare:  
 Trebuie sa ne informăm. Cum funcționează un guvern, un parlament, un consiliu local și o primărie. Astfel încât să putem să PRETINDEM realist ca cei din organismele de mai sus sa își facă treaba.   
Trebuie să încetăm cu ipocrizia. Nu există găinării și jafuri. Toate sunt hoții și toate duc la catastrofe într-un timp mai lung sau mai scurt. Dacă fiecare fură doar câte un bulon de la traversă, până la urmă trenul va deraia. Trebuie, mai ales, să încheiem cu ipocrizia din educație. Nu avem educație gratuită, nu avem educație de masă. Avem educație în care multe, prea multe teme de la clasele mici sunt pentru părinți și din păcate, diplomele și calificativele reflectă timpul îndemânarea și cunoștințele părinților, nu ale copiilor. Avem educație cu programa făcută după chipul și asemănarea profesorilor, nu după nevoile cetățeanului de mâine. Și aici, tu părintele trebuie să PRETINZI tratament corect, note care să reflecte cunoștințele copilului tău și programa  școlară pe măsură.   
Și, când suficient de mulți vom PRETINDE de la noi, vom începe să PRETINDEM  și de la cei care ne conduc sau care formează organismul cunoscut cu numele de STAT.   
Și atunci singurele ruguri vor fi cele ale ignoranței noastre...

2020-11-15 11:58:41 : Just some random text vomit on memories : nonninon : https://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/juktcu/just_some_random_text_vomit_on_memories/

One thing that really bothers me in dreams and lucid dreams is the sense of separation between the you in the real world and the dream. I think most people are familiar with the sense that you're inhibited and dumber in a dream, but it extends to various other matters like behavior and personality and even memories. You might be unrecognizably not you at times. And TBH this is a bother. It's always annoying to wake up and go, "Oh, I forgot to do this thing!" Or maybe "Why did I do this thing? I didn't want to do this thing!"

I've mainly made this post focusing on memories. Particularly, false memories and if it's possible to catch them in the act and recognize them before they lead you astray, and just recall of the real world in general.

So I've had a simple exercise in my head. I imagined it as such—I'd remember the previous day. Once I did, I would anchor myself to some point in the real world rather than the vague, wishy washy whatever and whenever nonsense that's usually the setting in dreams. And from here on out, I'd be more able to recognize dream world memories, and maybe even be more aware and able to remember and act on thoughts without priming for it.

Well after a long time I finally managed to remember this idea, and well, predictably enough I've veered off into some made up nonsense of a day which was completely off the track, fully believing that's what actually happened. At least I got the day right. My first thought was Monday but I corrected myself to Saturday quickly, but that's pretty much where it stopped. I'm not sure what I did wrong. Or if there was anything I could do about it. In the moment, I felt quite lucid, I made some accurate observations on my current state and tried to make sure to be mindful...

I'm not sure where to go from here, to be fair. Obviously I could just keep repeating the exercise until I get it right, but I think no shit I'm gonna get it right eventually. But that's not gonna help me recognize false memories and the like, I feel.

That's about it. Bye.

2020-11-15 11:58:51 : Are we still in the honeymoon phase? : angrychair_ : https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/juktf9/are_we_still_in_the_honeymoon_phase/

My boyfriend (18m) and I (18f) have been together over a year. He is so supportive, caring, funny, and understanding. He’s my best friend and I feel so comfortable around him. I can be super vulnerable with him and I trust him with my darkest secrets. We have lots of shared interests but also plenty of differences that keep things interesting. We have very infrequent disagreements, but whenever one of us is upset with the other, we talk and work it out immediately, as we think that good communication and honesty are two of the most important things that keep a relationship going. He’s never raised his voice at me, and vice versa. Sex is amazing and never gets boring and we’re always trying new things. He’s not just my boyfriend, but my best friend. Currently we’re long distance for university, but we video call most nights and message throughout the day, but not to an extent that holds us back from having our own lives - we are very supportive of each other doing our own thing. Things are going really well, despite what I was told about LDR’s in university. I can see a future with him and we’ve discussed our long term plans and goals and think that moving in together, etc. is not far out of reach, though we acknowledge that anything could happen between now and then. Both of us have flaws that the other recognizes, but I think it makes our relationship stronger. 

Recently, though, I’ve been wondering if this is part of the honeymoon stage or if this is just regular relationship territory. Both of us are the happiest we’ve ever been in this relationship, I’m almost euphoric whenever I’m with him, even if we’re both doing our own thing in each others’ presence, and it almost feels too good to be true. Should I be worried that eventually this will wear off? In the grand scheme of things, we haven’t been together very long, and as much as I love what we have right now, I don’t know if it’s realistic to expect the future to always be like this. 

On a related note, my friends and I were talking the other day about relationships and they all shared the sentiment that high school relationships usually never work out because they don’t give the individuals the time and space to grow as people and discover who they are. I’ve grown an insane amount as a person with my bf, and so has he, but both of us have a long ways to go - growth never stops. 

So I guess my questions are, am I in the honeymoon phase, and if so, what can I expect for the future? And is it realistic for a high school relationship to work out long term? Any insight is appreciated, and I know this post was long and ramble-y so let me know if you want me to clarify anything.

Hey everyone. There are two cartoon about witches. I'd really appreciate if someone could help me get started on this. I'm kinda confused:

"Connecting with your understanding of The Salem Witch trials and its relevance today and expression of personal opinion through creating a blog post, write a blog post based around these two images. Look for the overall impression created by the cartoon. Identify the issue or topic portrayed ((e.g., what message the cartoon is conveying and how the techniques used help to convey that message)

Talk about how witch trials are still relevant to today’s world and base the blog post through justification by the ideas portrayed in the pictures above. You can use the images to help formulate your arguments. You can relate these to a community (e.g.political , religious, gendered, under-privileged) 's perspective towards certain groups of people. Justify your response with the global context of identities and relationships."

2020-11-15 11:59:04 : For better or worse, the games are still mostly the same as Red and Green : Codraroll : https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/jukti9/for_better_or_worse_the_games_are_still_mostly/

Sorry, this is a long one, but I've put a TL;DR at the bottom.

---

A thought occurred to me the other day when I saw a list of features removed from the games over the generations, such as seasons, the PSS, Join Avenue, Battle Frontier, Mega Evolution, etc. You know, those pictures that were popular for a while around the launch of SwSh. At first I thought "sure, I miss those features too, but bringing them all back at the same time probably wouldn't be feasible". And then it was like something flipped. I no longer saw the picture as a list of features we would like to return, but as a *count* of how many times Game Freak have reverted a feature. 

It's commonly said about the Pokémon games that they take one step forwards, one step back. The list stood out to me as a count of how many steps were once taken forward and then back again. 

In that context, it didn't matter as much what those steps included. It was the idea of stepping forward-then-back that irked me. Each of those features - seasons, Mega Evolution, secret bases, etc. - represent a form of innovation around the core formula of Pokémon. Instead of building on those innovations, developing them into part of the core formula, they were rolled back. 

That got me thinking some more. Back to what? Back to a "default", it seems like. Back to the core formula. Back to the scope of Pokémon Red and Green.

For better or worse, things have not changed much in this franchise since the first games on the Game Boy. Or, well, the game mechanics have changed quite a bit. Held items, weather, three new types and some type chart tweaks, physical/special split, and of course Abilities. There is also a lot more Pokémon, moves, items, etc. to play with than before. But in terms of **content and scope**, the "core formula" if you want, things have stood still practically forever, and most deviations have been reverted as if they were one-time experiments that were never intended to stick. 

Gen III introduced Pokémon Contests, which as a concept was developed and changed slightly for two more generations before being absent from Gen VI on. Riding Pokémon was a limited thing for two generations and got booted again in Gen VIII. Secret Bases were there for two generations (three if you count the limited room decoration feature in Gen II), but the concept was abandoned in Gen V. Rollback, rollback, rollback. Always back to the precedent of Gen I. Games made in the late 1990s (released half a year before *Super Mario 64*, for context). We're in the 2020s now and content-wise, the games are largely the same now as they were back then.

Meanwhile, some things never change. The story is almost always the same. There's always a professor, an evil team, and a legendary Pokémon. Towns lie along numbered Routes like pearls on a string, and you visit them in a set order. The same Pokémon archetypes tend to be present in every generation (starters, regional birds, regional bugs, etc.). The game mechanics have evolved slightly as mentioned above, but remain mainly the same. A broad-strokes description of Red and Green would also describe Sword and Shield pretty well. 

It's as if the course of Pokémon was staked out back in the nineties, with a list of boxes the main series Pokémon games have to check, and any additional content would have to only be temporary. As if they're allowed to stick some extra bells and whistles on the series as long as they promise to take them away again later. Mechanics changes are allowed to stick (for the most part), but in terms of *things to do* in gameplay, there hasn't been a whole lot of progress since the GameBoy days.

On the other hand, the concepts being so familiar from one game to the next is part of what made Pokémon so successful. If you've played one Pokémon game before, you know exactly how to play them all. You know what you're going to get with a Pokémon game, and how you are going to get it. No need to find your way around new ways of doing things, no way of getting lost in a huge new overworld, or learning new battle mechanics, or keeping up with an intricate story. For the most part, every Pokémon, move, and item will behave exactly like it did in the previous game. If you've played and liked one Pokémon game, you can play and like them all. 

But then again, other franchises have thrived just fine by changing up their formula, it's not like players have abandoned them for changing minute details or even core assumptions of gameplay. And in some cases, I think it's fair to say Game Freak has been unreasonably stubborn in keeping things exactly as they were. Some Pokémon cries and menu sounds have been retained since the GameBoy days. The games feature a 3D camera in battle now, but every player action resets the camera to the over-the-shoulder view from the earlier generations - to the point that Pokémon models have been scaled down in battle to make this view look nice, rather than displaying the actual size of the Pokémon from a different angle. In the overworld, the camera is also mostly locked - although this may have been done to save time in development. 

It might just be me, but I think the games could do with a little bit more innovation over time, rather than always going back to the "safe choice" which is to make the games as much as possible like the debut game from the mid-1990s. But of course, if they stray too much from the safe path, the games will not be like they always were, which may upset the long-time fans. What are your thoughs on this balance?

---

TL;DR - in terms of content (not mechanics - usually) the games have a tendency over time to revert back to the norms established in Gen I. This may be seen as a lack of innovation, but also part of Pokémon's appeal, and balancing the two would be a very difficult act. Or would it?

2020-11-15 11:59:24 : Systematic crash on all 3x nodes running oVirt v4.3.10 : rocknstones : https://www.reddit.com/r/ovirt/comments/juktnd/systematic_crash_on_all_3x_nodes_running_ovirt/

Hi oVirt team, I upgraded all 3x of my nodes to v4.3.10 a few weeks ago and all 3 have systematically crashed during the last 10 days or so. 

  
Prior to the upgrade, the nodes had very long uptimes but something in the current running version (4.3.10) has changed causing node crash. Looking at the logs in /var/log/ there isn't anything specific that is indicative of the problem but the fact that all 3x nodes have had the same issue I'm convinced this version is causing kernel panic.

Is this something the team is aware of and looking into please? Thanks.

I am only selling this because of my financial situation. I am pretty down and out atm when it comes to funds. (.11) in my bank account. I havent used it in awhile,  and I'd rather someone get it that would use it more. Its kept in a smoke free home, cleaned daily.

It is in mint condition, has the newer faceplate, will come with original box, inserts, sd card, and USB cable for charging. Updated to latest firmware.

Synthstrom's list price was confirmed to be rising at least 100$ in 2021. So your return on investing in this piece of gear seems to be safe.

There is a listing on reverb right now for the same condition at 1199. So this is a great deal.

2020-11-15 11:59:34 : Patient Zero : DTCHUNT3R : https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/juktqg/patient_zero/

It’s November 2020, a scientist’s wife and children have unfortunately passed away due to the coronavirus, he becomes distraught by this and falls into a deep depression, over time he soon starts to discover evidence of the virus being man made in a lab as well as details, location, etc

The man’s depression turns to anger and this anger motivates him to spend the next 2 years developing an advanced suit of armour that allows him to travel anywhere throughout space and time

He travels back in time to before the outbreak when the virus was in its final stages of development and kills all of the scientists in the lab, before proceeding to release a shockwave from his suit that would destroy everything in the lab, including the virus, however as a result the energy from his suit was depleted, leaving him stranded in Wuhan, China in December 2019 (when reports of the virus first began) and unknowingly became infected with the virus, becoming Patient Zero

The man is unaware of himself being infected and accidentally spreads the virus around Wuhan, before eventually committing suicide as he feels he has secured his own younger self and family’s future in this new timeline an achieved his goal, however things play out exactly like the original timeline - Patient Zero still unidentified, the virus causes a worldwide pandemic, his family dies and what he doesn’t realise is that he’s created a closed loop of him travelling back in time to stop the spread of the virus, only to accidentally spread it himself and cause the pandemic which he then sets out to stop by later travelling back in time (a Bootstrap Paradox if you will)

First of all I'm glad to see everyone's posts on this issue.  
This new system I think has killed almost all hype for the upcoming expansion and this subreddit shows, I know there are a few posts in backlash to the flood but I'd say keep it up.  
I think devs to read the subreddit and hopefully they are not too disheartened I think with a few changes they could make hearthstone's progression system perfect for everyone.  


I think the main problems of this new system is:  
1) Quests become useless and give no imediate reward upon completion.  
2) Not every game mode earns you xp or completes quests.  
3) Best way to level is to ironically not play at all.  
4) Very little xp and the bar for leveling has no cap (or the cap is too high).  
5) People don't play the game for fun instead to grind.  
6) The diminishing returns will be catastrophic for expansions to come.

I think the fixes are simple and this is what I personally would like to see:  
1) The devs apologise and explain what went wrong with the system and how they've fixed it.  
2) You earn xp and gold for completing quests so we only gain from this new system.  
3) We don't get old expansion packs as rewards instead a pack redeem token.  
4) Every gamemode when played for an hour gives you 400 xp and completes quests.

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly the devs were very close to perfecting hearthstone but here has been blatent missinformation and it is clear that our anxieties before have gone unanswered, I hate to say it but its hard to trust team 5 anymore I think what they have done to the game has been amazing but this system ruins every little bit of hard work they have put in.

This issue won't blow over until everything about it is fixed this will plague every single expansion to hearthstone for years to come, a mediocre job won't actually fix things this subreddit is smart and they'll analyse the hell out of any system.  


TL;DR: New system bad, please keep making posts until it is fixed. Oger.

2020-11-15 12:00:30 : My homeschooling story, and how I overcame it : _U472bmt_ : https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeschoolRecovery/comments/juku79/my_homeschooling_story_and_how_i_overcame_it/

To give you all a little background, my story is a lot like some of yours. My mother was a Christian, but more of a “do as I say, not as I do” kind of Christian. She was an alcoholic, and eventually ended up cheating on and divorcing my father. She began homeschooling me and my brothers when I was 8 (my brothers were 6 and 10.). From that point on, my entire childhood seems like a dark, dreary, lonely, miserable blur, absent of any productivity, fond memories, or meaningful interactions. I had no friends, except for a girl I met when I was 12 who I clung to because she was the only person I could socialize with. I remember standing outside and listening to the kids play at the park down the street, wishing that I was normal like them. Id sometimes sit in my bed in the dark and just completely break down, sobbing uncontrollably. 

After 8 years of what felt like solitary confinement in a prison, I was able to convince my father that my mother was depriving us of everything that makes a human, human, and he sent me to public school, where I was thrust back into normal society as a junior in high school. I didn’t know anybody there, and everybody there seemed like they grew up together while I was wasting away in the shadows. I felt like an outsider, so I went to extreme measures to fit in and pretend I wasn’t a socially handicapped, academically challenged, insecure little boy. I kept the fact that I was homeschooled a secret (as I still do to this day as a grown man). I clung to whoever showed interest in me, because I didn’t know what other direction to go. I ended up sleeping with any girl who would let me, committing crimes with people I barely knew, and experimenting heavily with drugs and alcohol. I’d show up to class high or drunk so that I could pretend THAT was the reason I couldn’t comprehend the material. I was trying so hard to fit in, and I was also trying to find myself at the same time. 

After I graduated, I tried to go to community college, where I failed almost every class because I didn’t have enough knowledge of general education to pass. I dropped out and continued working for a bit, and then joined military. I wanted a thrill, a clear path, and to get as far away from my past as humanly possible. I also felt I needed some form of structure, because if left to my own devices, I would’ve had no idea what else to do. I am now in my mid 20s and have traveled all over America and the world. I’ve had a lot of great experiences, and met countless amazing people. I’ve been involved in several serious relationships, made friendships with people who feel more like family, built a good resume, and I’ve settled on the opposite side of the country. I rarely speak to or visit anybody in my family, and I’m starting to think I may actually just cut them all out of my life completely and live out the remainder of my life as the foundation for a new family of my own, destroying all the generational curses that have plagued my bloodline. 

What I really want to say, to anybody who has read this far, is that you are not alone. The insecurity, the inadequacy, the loneliness, the anger, the rage, it’s all normal. It will forever be a part of your story, whether you broadcast it to the world or not. But let it be a story of perseverance. Overcome the trauma and the negative emotions, pursue happiness like your lungs pursue oxygen. Build yourself into who you want to be until the depression and anxiety is all just a faint memory. 

Peace and love

2020-11-15 12:00:38 : Finally at peace being able to leave this game. : DatHungryHobo : https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/juku95/finally_at_peace_being_able_to_leave_this_game/

After play on and off for the past 7 years, I finally decided to pick up the climb the last few months of the season and make it to gold for the first time. Excited to actually receive ranked rewards for the first time while blissfully unaware of the point of the honor system, I decided to put ranked down and casually close out the season with norms. Unfortunately got my honor reset and was unable to climb it back up to level two before the season end and can't help but feel defeated. I don't think I can find the motivation I once had to do the climb again to have the rug pulled out from under me again and games just spark less joy now. 

I always find that writing things out gives some sense of catharsis and League being a game where I actually actively interacted with the community a lot more compared to other games I've played, I felt it was fitting to share my last thoughts. League has been a unique experience I won't forget. A lot of friendships made both online and IRL because of it. Thanks for the memories guys, tilt and all. Enjoy your time on the rift and good luck in the upcoming season as well as all the ones to follow.

2020-11-15 12:00:34 : Thoughts on beyond meat (BYND) ? : WhiteSha-dow : https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/juku88/thoughts_on_beyond_meat_bynd/

I’m fairly new to stock investing (only been in index funds the past two years or so). I’m looking at stocks to buy and hold for 5+ years and this one looks really good right now. I love the company’s dedication to innovation, R&amp;D, and expansion plans. They have excellent branding and marketing. I’m slowly seeing them growing into the mainstream food industry. 

Curious to see what people on here think about it? I understand that my opinions are purely on what I see as a customer, not so much numbers based.

Turned on my PS4 today and I got a notification about "my" cyberpunk preorder being delayed. I never pre-ordered cyberpunk, digitally or physically, so it really is confusing. At first I thought it was a message they sent out to all players but when I asked a few friends who said they didn't receive a notification, I started thinking it's an isolated case. 

Anyone else receive one of these notifications?

Hi guys!

I’m brand new to the sport of snowboarding and me and my little brother were looking to take a vacation up to Colorado on the weekdays of December 14th. Get there Monday. Ski/Snowboard for 3 days. Leave on Friday.

I’ve been doing a lot of research of places to go on a budget, since we are broke college students, and was hoping to get some of ya’ll’s sage advice.

Our budget for the whole thing said and done is about $500 each. I know. Woah. That’s crazy cheap, but we’re really trying to make this budget as shoe string as possible.

What are our options? I’ve looked at potential candidates for slopes and I’ve narrowed it down to Loveland and Winter Park based on price and potential snowfall alone. Am I overlooking any other gold mines?

What would you recommend we do for a trip like this at this budget. What is realistically possible? Any advice is welcome, weather you think I’m a moron or genuinely want to help, let me know!

Each of the fans have 4 pin connectors, and on the box there's a sticker saying "PWM". 


My motherboard has:

So will I be able to make the pc automatically control fan speed based to temperatures, or will I at least be able to set the fan speed to 50% or 75%?

I am using Asus DSL-N12U\_C1 in [WAN Transfer mode](https://i.imgur.com/m5jTk2n.png). Basically using a LAN port as a WAN port. How much maximum download and upload speed can I get like this on this specific router model? Can't seem to find any specifications for this mode. Since it is a 300 Mbps wireless router I expect it to at least get 300Mbps but I am getting about \~80 Mbps on a 150 Mbps connection. The connection does give 150 Mbps when connected directly to the modem.

2020-11-15 12:02:01 : I need to spend 2000 EUR of PhD budget by the end of the year, with some constraints. Help! : falkets : https://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/jukutk/i_need_to_spend_2000_eur_of_phd_budget_by_the_end/

At the end of the year I will submit my PhD thesis. December 30th is also the deadline to spend my research budget (extra money on top of the scholarship), which I usually I allocated to conferences (fee + trip + room + food etc.) but this year I did not because of COVID.  

I can spend this budget on conferences, summer(winter schools and related costs; software; academic books and articles; and open access publication fees. Unfortunately, I cannot buy hardware.

However, currently 1) I use open-source software only for my research; 2) I have access to papers and books either through the uni or through sci-hub; 3) 2021 does not foresee any nice conference in presence, and I am seek of online events; 4) I do not have forthcoming papers for which I need to pay a fee.

Any nice idea? Should I spend 2000 EUR in hard-copy handbooks? Should I subscribe to a couple of hard-copy good journals (e.g. Nature, Science etc.)? Or any other creative way of spending this money? 

Any unethical researcher would add: "does anybody need some budget for your research? I can pay your publication fees, if you add me as a co-author to the paper". But this last bit was only to trigger you guys, don't worry :D

Hey lovely ENFPs - I have a friend's (ENFP, F) birthday coming up, but with all the COVID restrictions I can't meet her in person for a while. I also don't have an address for her so can't mail anything.

Now here's where I'm stuck. I'm trying to come up with things I can make/find/compile that can be emailed or sent to her virtually to at least go some way towards being a birthday gift. A friend of mine got sent a bunch of poems for her birthday during the stay at home restrictions for example.

I'm really not sure what I can do though...She's very important to me, and we've had a bit of a rough patch without being able to actually communicate in person. We're both in our mid-20s by the way if that helps.

Wonderful ENFPs, what would you love to receive in this way? Or would it not be well received?

Thanks! (INFJ, M)

Not sure if your corporate reads this stuff but I was at one of your locations yesterday and it was miserable. Busy as shit with 3-4 employees running around. Customers all pissed. Employees disgruntled I'm sure. 

We now have WAY more cases of Covid EVERYWHERE than we did when Bestbuy initially went curbside only early this year. Whatever profit you're generating from keeping stores open is simply not worth it for long term health and wellbeing of your employees. Unless you plan on churning all your store staff after the pandemic this is not a good strategy. 

It's like because federally our country has abdicated responsibility it's trickling down to corporations and people. Time to take responsibility. You're just looking for trouble keeping your doors open towards the end of this month. Releasing consoles online only is not gonna stop an army of people trying to buy cheap shit the week of thanksgiving at the height of the public health emergency in this country.

Back in 2010 I went on a group trip in Nepal, and there were 3 people there from the US who all knew of what what perhaps the best card game I've ever played. 

It involved two teams of two players (I'm certain it wasn't bridge) and the game started with the letter 'M'. 

The game was very strategic, did not involve communication between team members, and I belive it used a single pack of cards (not entirely certain). 

Let me know any thoughts, would love to rediscover it!

Currently am almost done with the 1st semester year for Uni and feeling quite bored since I have a lot of free time now till early January next year, so hence I am open to answering any questions that any of you all may have with regards to NUS Chemistry.

P.S. I will be doing another AMA in Feb/March period too, after my sem 2 mid terms or so since this AMA seems a bit 'impromptu' HAHA

About Myself:

* Was a BCME Student in JC, and currently a Year 1 Student in NUS Chem
* A current NUS Merit Scholar in NUS Chem
* Not staying on campus (so won't be able to answer any qns regarding Halls/RCs :S)

Warning: Uni Chemistry is nothing like JC Chemistry. It's more of applied math/physics inclined for quite some modules. That being said, despite not having a physics background myself, I would say I'm coping rather well in all my chem mods so far.

Should you all have any questions pertaining to NUS Chemistry, or other matters like scholarship application, feel free to ask here and I will reply asap!

2020-11-15 12:05:34 : After 15 years of BlackBerry I'm now a Sony user : HairWhatIsItGoodFor : https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyXperia/comments/jukw9n/after_15_years_of_blackberry_im_now_a_sony_user/

I've had just about every BlackBerry mobile for over 15 years. My last phone was the BlackBerry Motion which I absolutely loved. 3 weeks into having the Xperia One II I can tell you it's unbelievably close to the experience of having a BlackBerry Motion. 
The Motion had all these features which the Xperia also has
* 4000ma battery
* LED notification light
* Rapid charge
* SD Card expansion
* Headphone Jack
* Fingerprint sensor
* Vanilla Android experience
* Dual SIM

What I get over and above that with the One II is
* Wireless charging
* 5G
* Android 10 vs 8
* Decent camera

What I'll miss
* Front fingerprint sensor
* Hearing people say "That's a BlackBerry?"

The fingerprint sensor being on the side is something I'm trying to get used to especially if you have the phone flat and an app needs to read your fingerprint. Gets annoying to have to pick up the phone each time.

Finding a case in Australia meant having to scour eBay and even then meant having to modify to make it fit properly around where the fingerprint sensor was. Without a case it was an unbelievably slippery phone, must have dropped as t least 20 times in the first fortnight without the cover. Phone would just slide itself off any surface like it had its own mind.

Overall a good phone and a very familiar experience coming from a BlackBerry.

2020-11-15 12:05:59 : How to consistently take a shower? : Mohk72k : https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/jukwg4/how_to_consistently_take_a_shower/

I have made great strides for myself the last few years as a person with Bipolar Disorder and ADHD, three years ago was essentially when I finally went on my "golden standard" medication regimen, and I can finally say I have beat my depression to the bin, and I've never since experienced hypomania since then.

Although I may not experience depression or hypomania like before, I still feel unmotivated to do the things I need to do. I'm still content and happy though! And I can say that I haven't experienced depression in a while since starting that medication regimen. But I for one still have a big problem which is taking consistent showers.

I don't know why it's so hard for me to just get in the shower. In my perfect ideal world, I'd want to take a 5-10 minute shower everyday. But at times I go far as a week without a shower, and that messes up my self esteem and general mood. I legitimately feel so happy when I'm nice and clean! I enjoy the showering process too, but for some reason, I just can't bring myself to that initial step which is to go in the bathroom, shave, and step into the shower. That's the hardest part for me, and I don't know why.

It would be life changing if I had the ability to take a shower every 1-2 days, even if it is just fine minutes. But I don't know why I dread doing that initial step so much. I want to have the culture and routine of taking a shower everyday, like how I clean my teeth everyday and such.

I feel like I really wanna fix this aspect of myself tbh, since I am taking great strides for myself lately. But this is an undeniable residual effect from bipolar disorder, and to an extension ADHD. Like now I'm happy! But it's time to get actually productive, and I struggle with being productive.  


Does anyone have advice on this? I would really appreciate it!

Hi /r/sysadmin,

I am currently testing fslogix with the traditional VHD location on a Windows fileshare and everything works like a charm.

Now I'm having a look at Cloud Cache. I'm trying to use it for potential offline clients like notebooks and not the traditional way (storage redundancy)

I linked a GPO with VHD location enabled on the VDI OU and a GPO with Cloud Cache enabled on the notebook OU.

Is it correct that I cannot reference VHD location and Cloud Cache Location to the same path since Cloud Cache creates a meta file and therefore it cannot be used as Profile Container further?

I am trying to archive that a user can use his VDI profile on his laptop with Cloud Cache

Thanks by advance

**ZENON** So first off  we've seen him do bone spikes, yes bone spikes it's kind of like Mars' mineral magic but Zenon's magic is boosted by his unnamed demon which uses spatial magic, so with his bone magic he can incapacitate you when he spikes all your limbs, now I get that Yami was already exhausted in the Dante fight but I wonder why he didn't even try to struggle, but I can probably see why it's because his bones are harder due to the devil power, because like Yuno he wasn't even able to cut his bone magic, and Yami didn't even have his grimoire or his sword so there was no way he could fight back, as for Zenon's spatial magic it's like the convinient spatial magic, he can make portals, he can make spatial barriers that take a fat nut to break just like the barrier mage in the eye of the midnight sun encasing Yami in the watchroom with the old dude.    


**DANTE** From what we've seen from Dante he has body magic and gravity magic from his devil Lucifero. With his body magic boosted by devil powers he can't die unless struck with an Anti-Magic attack because he will just regenerate lost body parts. With body magic he can also become a giant meat man, he can also make the muscles ricochet off his body like a fucking spider. It looks kinda like the tendrils from the game Prototype 1 and Prototype 2, where your arms become a web like substance and can go spider man on your enemies, that's basically all the things for his body magic, it's just immortality and spider man, but his immortality is useless before Anti-Magic. Now his main power which is Gravity Magic that he got from simping over Lucifero, from what we've seen the gravity can apply to every type of magic unless it's Dark Magic, i.e. when the Black Bulls tried to attack Dante with magic he just went Gravity Magic : Presence of the Demon King, then all the magic attacks dropped to the ground like it was a fat woman falling from the sky. And apparently he can increase the speed and power of his physical abilities like punching, like when he literally ORA ORA'D Asta knocking him unconscious. Oh yeah and his Presence of the Demon King move can make other people fall to the ground unable to move like being pinned down by a fat dude. He can also bring up large rocks and shave the sides to make swords, he used this move on Gauce to make Asta angry and use more devil power. He can also make a small sword for he to wield. When he goes to 60% Devil mode he can make other magic around him useless just like he did with Vanessa's cat where it just disintegrated into thin air when he amped up his devil power. He can also warp space making him able to teleport around, he can also condense gravity almost making something like a black hole that sucks everything in it, it's like the Cream stand from Jojo's Bizarre Adventure Part 3, and like Okuyasu's the hand move where you can erase space.    


**VANICA** From what we know, Vanica has Blood Magic and Curse-Warding Magic from her devil Megicula. We know that her devil boosted Blood Magic is stronger than Noelle's strongest spell Sea Dragon's Roar because she can just break through her magic like paper with her Blood Magic :  Red Beast. From what we've seen trying to drown her is kinda useless because from what Loropechika said apparently blood is harder to congeal under water thus making her Blood Magic under water useless. But that's not the case devil boosted Blood Magic almost has the same congealing properties on land or under water. With her Blood Magic she can also make big ass claws to slash apart anyone who tries to come close, she also has an unnamed move when she make spiked blood go flying forward damaging anyone in front of her, this was the move she used against Noelle in her last struggle against her. That's all that I observed from her Blood Magic, now as for her Devil Magic "Curse-Warding Magic", Curse-Warding magic is a pretty OP magic if you ask me because she can cast her Curses also instantly, because she cursed Undine the water spirit and yes, I didn't see her charging up her magic to curse the water spirit she straight up pulled up to Undine and cursed her, there's also her move where it's like Genjutsu Reversal where you can make your own enemy use their own spells against them like what she did to Nero, when Nero tried to seal Vanica she actually sealed Nero instead but a weaker version of her seal, but that was thanks to her Curse-Warding Magic : Decaying World, all spells used against her arcane or not is weakened. She can also make other people immortal and also make them turn into nukes just like Nagasaki and Hiroshima.    


TLDR:    
Zenon magic is bone spikes + portals and barriers (Spatial Magic)   


Dante magic is big meat boi and spider man web with muscles + Gravity magic make everything have immense weight and erase space and matter   


Vanica magic is blood bending but can also make claws and spikes + Instant curse spells and weaken every type of magic and she can also nuke people

2020-11-15 12:07:10 : Constipated for over 3 months? : 8thManBound : https://www.reddit.com/r/Constipation/comments/jukwwo/constipated_for_over_3_months/

I rarely ever used to get constipated- the only other times I can remember were during two separate vacations, and even then I could fix it within a week using prune juice. But early this August, I became constipated again, and this time, it wouldn’t go away. 

Sometimes there’ll be times where I’ll be able to go semi regularly if I eat high-fiber foods and drink a ton of water, but there have also been stretches of time where I won’t be able to get anything out at all. I’ve tried fiber, drinking more water, and Miralax then and they don’t really seem to help. I always seem to have incomplete evacuation.

I’m not sure where I’m going with this, I guess I’m just confused why all of a sudden I became constipated and it won’t go away, and most of all wondering how I can fix this. Thanks for any help.

2020-11-15 12:07:48 : ˈbrōkən : ItzzzWoody : https://www.reddit.com/r/LoserleavesReddit/comments/jukx50/ˈbrōkən/

*the camera pans around an abandoned carnival. Empty popcorn stalls litter the area as crows pick off remnants of what was once popcorn. Coming into frame is Woody who is brandishing a long trench coat. He has a black beanie with cut up Jean's to match.
   As he turns around you catch a glimpse of the Hardcore title which is draped over his shoulder*

Woody: I've always followed the motto "do the work, then talk". After coming out of my dirt grave thanks to Besty I sought no vengeance. Instead I wanted to embrace him and say...thank you. Thank you for ridding me of the last bit of humanity that even Mr.Happy couldn't reach.

 *Woody drops to his knees*

Woody: I'm a new man now with new ambitions and goals. I brushed that dirt aside and got to work as I brought prestige back to the Hardcore Championship. I welcomed each Challenger with a smile but they left with a frown.

 *Woody lays down*

Woody: Now to reach the path of the man of 1000 faces I must face a foe that is no stranger to The Revelry. Ahead of me lies Alexander. 

 *Woody sits back up with a grin on his face*

Woody: You've played with Mr.Happy, but now it's my turn. I will show you what it truly feels like to be broken.
  As I bring up fresh memories of how your tag partner attacked your own child, abandoned you in your title defense, are you going to put on a mask and pretend everything is okay?

 *The camera quickly switches to show Woody in his mask now. A low pitch channeling through his voice as he remains stoic*

 Woody: Don't think I've forgotten that it was you and your little posse who destroyed the Utopic Emblem HQ. Dont think that you can just peg me to be just another "creepy cult guy"

HAIL THE REVELRY. HAIL THE REVELRY. HAIL THE REVELRY.

*the camera slowly goes to black as the last thing you see is Woody's mask staring back at you.*

2020-11-15 12:07:57 : Help a newbie start an uprising : Hylir : https://www.reddit.com/r/genestealercult/comments/jukx7d/help_a_newbie_start_an_uprising/

I'm looking to get into genestealer cults, because as soon as I first heard about them, they became my second favourite army based on their theme and lore alone. So I always wanted to start a force, the price of the models put me off but I finally feel ready to go for it.

My question is this, I want to start a Hivecult force, do people think it'd be alright if I use brood brothers as count as neophyte hybrids, provided I don't actually bring any brood brothers in-rules, apart from heavy weapons teams?

Alternatively I'm thinking of going for a twisted Helix Force using Catachans with genestealer cult upgrade sprues as neophytes, although I'm less interested in that option.

I know I could always go for the smart option of a normal genestealer cult force with all the official models, but I like doing "unique" things like this and think outside the box, just a little

2020-11-15 12:07:54 : 23 y/o, New to this and looking for advice on index funds : jenkosamples : https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/jukx6l/23_yo_new_to_this_and_looking_for_advice_on_index/

Ok so id like to make a diverse index fund portfolio that I can put money into monthly and leave till I'm old. Don't have any debt and have emergency fund but currently no job so will only be making small initial contributions to start with and then once I have income ill put more money into them monthly.

My thinking was to go 60/40 Stock/bond (or maybe 60/30/10 Stock/bond/REIT ???)

Id have 60/40 US/international for each Stock and Bond and then allocate money using these percentages into a vanguard account?? The minimum of £500 investment for each one is allot for me but I could balance them out to the percentages I want when I start earning? Recently received £1500 inheritance and would like to make something of it so that would cover 3 minimum investments anyway. 

So I was thinking of having a total US stock index (or shall I just get the S&amp;P 500 and let that just be my total us stock even tho its not 100%). A total international Stock index. A total US Bond and a total international Bond (or shall I just combine the two and just have one global Bond index? These minimum investments are obviously going to be more impactful the more I have). Then maybe a REIT or I might just get that further down the line when I start earning again.

Shall I and can I achieve this with vanguard? Which funds would you choose out of their options to achieve this? Or will somewhere else achieve this better. I obviously want to keep costs down to minimum. 

What are your thoughts on my plan? Is this wise or should I be doing something else. Id like to spend the time now to figure out where I will be putting my money and stay the course. Maybe reshuffling the weightings of stock/bonds down the line when I'm older.

Many thanks

So the category name(?) and the personal information stuff. The demo of the theme has enough categories for my needs, I really just need to change the texts and don't know where I can.

2020-11-15 12:08:49 : 5M Toddler facial laceration : SynbiosVyse : https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/jukxl6/5m_toddler_facial_laceration/

My son fell and cut the top part of his cheek, the bleeding was bad so I brought him to the ED and he got glued on steristrips. I'm very concerned now that the skin didn't come together nicely because it was inverted. I thought they were going to put glue over the laceration and pull the skin together better, but the way I saw it going together under the steristrips really makes me think the scar will be bad. I've been looking around plastic surgeons but it's Sunday and no place is open. I was thinking about going back to a bigger hospital ED and getting a second look to see if they can suture it. 

Does it make sense to go now while time is of the essence or start calling places in another day (Monday) when offices open?

This thread is for any arts and/or crafts creation that you've made and would like to share. Have a five-minute fanart sketch of Legolas? Have a super intricate drawing of a phoenix? Done some fantasy-related woodworking, cross-stitching, jewelry-making, cosplay, knitting, pottery, etc. etc. etc.? This is the thread to show it off!

The only craft not allowed is writing, sorry. We appreciate all our writers/authors very much, but there are already a few places where you can discuss fantasy writing with other Redditors (e.g. r/fantasywriters).

Absolutely no worries if you’re a beginner - this is a thread for creativity and enthusiasm, not for competition. Also, this doesn't mean posting arts/crafts the rest of the month is discouraged - it's just a place for everyone who doesn't want to start their own thread. If you’re looking to discuss a project you'd like to start or are currently working on, this is the place for that as well.

2020-11-15 12:09:42 : Frequently Asked Questions : CJ_Jones : https://www.reddit.com/r/bakeoff/comments/jukxxz/frequently_asked_questions/

What is the Great British Bake Off / Great British Baking Show?

&gt;It is a competition show in which a dozen or so bakers each year take part in a competition to become "Britain's best amateur baker" over the course of 10 weeks in which they will have to bake cake, biscuits, puddings, desserts, bread, and patisserie. Each week a baker will be eliminated and one will be crowned Star Baker if they performed the best that week.

--

Where can we watch?

&gt; People in the UK can watch on Channel 4 at 8pm GMT on Tuesdays, and people in the US can watch on Netflix with the most recent episodes being released on Fridays at 8am EST. There are other third party sites that we cannot condone due to it not being entirely legal or safe. But VPN's exist if you want to get to the US Netflix or UK Channel 4 so....

--

&gt; [Name] was so consistent / good, why did they get eliminated?

&gt; The eliminations are judged week by week and all it takes is a bad week to be sent home. They very rarely have used previous weeks to split the difference between potential eliminations. But in the event of injury or dead-heat to the bottom the judges may forgo an elimination in favour of a double elimination the next week.

--

Is it just me or are this year's (2020) bakers 'rubbish'?

&gt;All of these contestants are in a production (COVID) lock down with the crew and hosts.

&gt;1) They can’t go home to family, friends and work between episodes, OR their families had to commit to lockdown with them ON LOCATION which could be a long way from home and work for them too.

&gt;2) they can’t practise their signatures and showstoppers at home between shooting days. They had BTS stuff showing they have practise kitchens to work on them but no ones dad has been in the shed to make them a pumpkin carriage cutting template for a cake, or a stand to hold up a 13 foot croquembouche.

&gt;3) I haven’t seen if it confirmed, but since they’re in production lockdown I doubt they have as long between shooting days to practise on their recipes and designs and construction.

&gt;These restrictions absolutely had to change who could apply as well as their personal preparation to previous seasons.

--

Why do they wear the same clothes on both days? (Or why do they say "the next day" if it's just the same day)

&gt;Bake Off each week is filmed over two days typically Friday and Saturday and the consistent clothing is so that the video editors can smoothly cut between whatever shots/reactions/interviews they like and not have the viewers find it odd or jarring. The bakers often do their own laundry at the end of the day so the shirts can remain wearable. (But that said towards the end Jane's year just said sod it and just wore it again regardless of cleanliness)

--

Why don't they have air conditioning in the tent?

&gt;Short answer: Noise

&gt;Long answer : The noise generated by the fans even if the air conditioning units was located as far away as the power generators still gets picked up on the microphones. The same goes for heaters with Jane and Iain reporting that they would have heaters to take the edge off before beginning. (Mary had a hot water bottle)

--

Why are they still in a tent?

&gt; It's iconic to the show even though it is a hangover from Series 1 where they did go around the country. But why they don't go indoors for the ice cream or chocolate weeks I really don't know.

Paul only kept [name] in becuase he wants to sleep with her/him.

&gt; No. 

--

[Name] should have gone out instead of [Name]

&gt; That's definitely a case by case discussion but you can normally put it down to how badly they struggled with the showstopper. A person who flounders in the first two challenges and then nails the showstopper will win out against a baker that "scored" average, average, poor in the three challenges.

&gt; More specifically, Series 5/Season 1 &gt;!Ian instead of Diane, he had a meltdown, failed to present due to a deliberate action despite the adversities he faced. And given the challenges coming up he would have struggled a lot!&lt;

&gt; Series 8 / Season 5 &gt;!Any decision involving Stacey or Kate. Hopefully someone else can answer this because I certainly wasn't level-headed when that series was going one. Bloody stroopwaffles!&lt;

&gt; Series 9 / Season 6 &gt;!Rahul and Manon. Manon made raw, burnt, congealed butter soaked croissants during Danish week. She additionally didn’t follow the brief on something she should be able to master. Rahul didn’t cover himself in glory though and was pretty close to being eliminated!&lt;

It has lots of lines with \`Err\`, Im not sure what they mean (and the internet didn't help). I had previously tried DUAL booting with Windows (following this guide: [1 Disk + Winders/Loonix](https://hackintosh-multiboot.gitbook.io/hackintosh-multiboot/uefi/1-disk-+-winders-loonix)) and dual booting with Ubuntu, but I get the same errors, so in simplifying I removed them.

Towards the end, I get 

\- disk3s3: device is write locked

\- Failed to bootstrap path: path = /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/...

**Problems?:**

\- There might be some bios settings I have yet to change, but I have since spent hours making sure all the configs are set correctly in the MSI bios settings. Notably I wasn't able to find \`Execute Disable Bit\`, \`Intel Platform Trust\`, \`Parallel Port\` in MSI BIOS menu, but was able to follow everything else [here](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/config.plist/comet-lake.html#intel-bios-settings). As I write this, I have just double checked all the settings are correct in the BIOS menu.

\- In making things simplier, I am trying to use the configs that have been confirmed to work here by u/anmol92verma, [https://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/hujvrk/success\_z490\_opencore\_059\_intel\_i7\_10700/](https://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/hujvrk/success_z490_opencore_059_intel_i7_10700/). I did change one aspect, \`AAPL,ig-platform-id\` is set to \`0300C89B\` to use dGPU instead of iGPU.

\- Maybe my SSD (Crucial P1 1 TB CT1000P1SSD8) is not compatible (hence the device is write locked errors)? Not sure how to validate this without buying another SSD.

**My hardware:**

*  Intel Core i7-10700K Unlocked Processor
* XFX RX 5700 XT Triple Dissipation 8GB
* MSI MPG Z490 GAMING PLUS ATX Motherboard for Intel LGA1200 CPUs
* Corsair Vengeance Pro RGB 32GB DDR4 3200MHz CL16 2x16GB Dual Channel Memory Kit
* Crucial P1 1 TB CT1000P1SSD8 Internal Solid State Drive
* Fenvi T919 (mac compatible) wifi &amp; bluetooth card

I can confirm my processor, graphics, motherboard and network card should be compatible.

*Hello, furriend.  My name is Cole.  I’m a four-month-old Bombay boy with silky, jet-black fur, who is a regal mini-panther.  I love to strut around my kingdom looking for an innocent catnip mouse to pounce or a feather wand to catch.  I also love to chase the red dot (laser) and paw a ball across the room.  
And when I am not playing with my toys, I love to sit on my cat tree watching birds and lizards out of the window.  But the outdoors are too dangerous for me so I must be an indoor-only cat.  
I have a short fur and don’t require much maintenance, but if you want to brush me and tell me that I look pretty, I would not mind.  
Bombays are an athletic breed and we’re sometimes referred to as “brick wrapped in silk” because of our muscular build.  Playing with me for 10 minutes each day will help me stay healthy and in top shape.  
I am house-trained, up-to-date on all my shots, I’m micro-chipped, and already have been neutered.  
So if you feel like you can be a loving family for me to spend my entire life with you then please fill out my adoption questionnaire and reference my name and number.  I hope we can have a play-date soon.  
Love and purrs,  
Cole*

2020-11-15 12:09:58 : A second Fire Emblem character - How is it viable? : GTAlpha7 : https://www.reddit.com/r/McLeodGaming/comments/juky28/a_second_fire_emblem_character_how_is_it_viable/

Before someone laughs, hear me out.  


I know that after Byleth *nobody* wants anything to do with Fire Emblem in Smash. I was there when Hoes Mad was a thing (for the five minutes it lasted before it became annoying), trust me.

&amp;#x200B;

But... Think about it. When looking at the roster as it is now, it feels a bit... Weird. Sure, we have characters like Lloyd, Sora, and the anime quartet, but just one FE character. 

&amp;#x200B;

The point I'm trying to make is if a second FE character could be viable. While I fully believe adding more FE chars is NOT in the devs plan... Only one character feel weird, especially now with the series being so closely related to Smash.

&amp;#x200B;

This is NOT a suggestion for the devs, rather taking the current FE roster, and list any possible pros and cons. And no, I'm not considering characters outside of the roster since that's a topic that deserves an entirely separate discussion. 

~~although celica as a mage user would be pretty cool. dammit.~~

&amp;#x200B;

Spoiler alert - This one's pretty long. You've been warned.

&amp;#x200B;

**LUCINA**

Pros: Well... The fact that she's one of the most popular FE characters as a whole? When you think of Awakening, a good chunk of you will immediately think of Lucina. In fact, Koei Tecmo almost didn't include her in FE Warriors, only for Intelligent System to inform them there were going to be riots if she wasn't included. Plus, FE Heroes has *5* variants, including the one that was just announced (that made her look like 11 for some reason). People like Lucina, and it shows.

Cons: The little issue of a combat moveset. While Project M did came up with a different moveset, I'm not too sure if the devs are willing to use that as a basis. Plus I'm pretty sure Echo Fighters won't be a thing, so...

&amp;#x200B;

**ROY &amp; CHROM**

&amp;#x200B;

Pros: For Roy it's legacy (got introduced in Melee like Marth) and for Chrom it's fan appeal. While, yes, they aren't radically different from Marth and Lucina, sometimes less is more and... Let's face it, you don't need a complicated moveset to leave an impression. Plus, they are voiced by Bucciarati and Jotaro. Let that sink in.

Cons: Ironically, the fact that they aren't that different from Marth and Lucina. What is the difference between the four? With Marth and Lucina you have to keep the distance, while you have to be up close and personal with Roy and Chrom. Is that enough of a motive to make people want to play Roy and Chrom? Or, rather, is that enough of a motive to justify their entry, especially since I get the feeling the devs want characters to feel signficantly different from one another? Yeah, that's an issue...

&amp;#x200B;

**IKE**

Pros: While not as popular as Lucina and Chrom, he's still relevant in one way or another (Path of Radiance and Radiant Dawn were FE's most well-known titles before Awakening and Fates happened). Plus he's *WAY* different from Marth, so his inclusion wouldn't be exactly redundant.

Cons: ...I can't honestly think of one.

&amp;#x200B;

**ROBIN (or Daraen if you live in Europe)**

Pros: Again, the popularity of Awakening being a major factor. I mean, there *is* a reason why a lot of people say Awakening saved the franchise. I know, it's lame, but it's the best I can come up with

Cons: They might be too similar to Black Mage, only with a tome and a funny-shaped sword that can emit magic. Oh, and boobs. All the things I said about Roy and Chrom apply here, as well.

&amp;#x200B;

**CORRIN (hoo boy this gon be a good one)**

Pros: Despite what people may have said to you, Corrin is quite a popular character. Okay, it has more to do with Fem!Corrin's appearance, but that's still a point in favor to them. Plus, her being half-dragon could create an interesting moveset. 

Cons: ...Where do we even start with them? Fates' not-so-fondly-remembered legacy, their infamy amongst FE fans (they are considered the worst avatar characters of the bunch) and how they got in Smash 4 before Fates was even released. Basically, imagine the Byleth fiasco but with Corrin and in 2014. These are all points going against their inclusion and someone I'm pretty sure the devs won't tackle even at gunpoint.

&amp;#x200B;

**BYLETH**

Pros: If you take away the memes and the outrage, Byleth has possibly the most unique moveset of the bunch. I mean, four weapons for one character isn't exactly something to scoff at. Okay, sure, 3 of them are relegated to Specials and Smash Attacks, but with a bit of tweaking they can be more featured.

Cons: Well... By now everyone should be familiar with the Byleth fiasco, so I'm not going to dwell into that much further

&amp;#x200B;

And... That's it. Like I said, I'm not going to mention characters that aren't in Smash (like Alm or Celica), because they deserve an entirely different approach, and I'm simply not too willing to open that Pandora's Box.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, this is NOT meant to be a request for the devs, rather my theory on who could be likely and what are their chances.

&amp;#x200B;

~~although celica could be a good idea-- god dammit...~~

&amp;#x200B;

What's your take on this?

2020-11-15 12:10:17 : Your sleeping arrangements : Icy_Kaleidoscope3808 : https://www.reddit.com/r/prepping/comments/juky6n/your_sleeping_arrangements/

Preparation for staying overnight should begin one and a half to two hours before dark. It is better not to make a camp in the lowlands, where it is always colder, but woodless hilltops are not the best option either - you will suffer from strong winds, and in case of thunderstorms this place is not safe.

&amp;#x200B;

The bivouac, located in a dense forest, is uncomfortable - the abundance of mosquito will not let you rest , and after the rain the water will drip from the trees for a long time. In spruce forests, it is usually colder than in larch or pine forests. And the humidity is higher in spruce woods: the sun rays here almost do not reach the ground.

&amp;#x200B;

  Do not be deceived by the soft carpet of moss. The moss cover has an amazing ability to accumulate water not only in depressions and flat surfaces, but even on gentle slopes, creating a swampy area. 

&amp;#x200B;

In cold and wet weather, before setting up a tent, the ground can be warmed up by a fire and then laid on it a layer of stubble, bark, dry leaves or even better to make a bed of fern leaves, because it contains little moisture and does not pull it out of the soil.

&amp;#x200B;

If there is no tent it is possible to build a primitive shelter. One of them is  a shelter made of spruce branches, which are bent into the ground and bent by the arc. To protect from rain cover it  with aspen branches  . In such a shelter you can only lay down.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The shelter can be also a tree, broken or turned to the root, for which protruding upward lower branches and twigs need to cut down and lay on the sides. 

&amp;#x200B;

But such shelters only briefly become a haven for a man. For long-term parking is appropriate to build a more capital housing, for example, a shack. For this purpose, two stakes with horns on top, each 1.5 meters long, you need to hammer into the ground at a distance of 2-3 meters from each other, and at the forks to lay a horizontal pole. To the pole at an angle lean vertical poles and fix them with ropes, and then parallel to the frame to strengthen the rafters, on which the strap is laid.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Shack can be installed around the trunk of the tree. To do this, the lower branches of the tree to cut down, lean on the trunk vertical poles and weave them with branches or ropes. On the resulting frame is laid strap. If there is a polyethylene film or tarpaulin, it will help make the shelter more comfortable and windproof.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

If there is a tent, you can build a tepee. For this purpose, a frame of at least 5 poles, which are connected to each other at the top and installed in the form of a cone, covered with a tarp . After the pole is extended until the fabric is stretched. Its lower edge is fixed to the ground with stones or pegs. If you have to spend the night in a swampy area, you can build a bed on the floor. For this purpose, a reed or a horn is perfect.

2020-11-15 12:10:34 : Question regarding shadowbans on Youtube Livestreams : DresdenPTL : https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/jukyag/question_regarding_shadowbans_on_youtube/

Hi, so I'm usually an active commenter in this livestreamer's streams that I follow, but I noticed last night that apparently my comments aren't going through and after checking from a different browser, it seems that I got shadowbanned.

For full clarity, I'm not really spamming anything, but because the streamer is Japanese and I usually translate/interpret for her live (voluntarily), I put a certain tag like \[EN\] or \[英訳\] so she knows she can ignore my comments on chat and other non-Japanese viewers can locate my translations more easily. 

Now I think it might have been because I kept using the same tag over and over, which probably might have caused me to be flagged as a spammer and shadowbanned?

So the question I have is: Is there a tentative duration before being un-shadowbanned? I'd like to know if it might have been a result of either an AI flagging me as a spammer, or possibly the channel owner herself shadowbanning me (in which case I can talk to her to rectify the situation).

My school is so draining, I’m wracked with stress, I have wild mood swings, I’ve been getting more anxious year after year, and I can’t stop working. It really makes me feel like I’ve been crushed under the weight of my education and I’ll never recover. The only saving grace is that it’s my last year of high school.

2020-11-15 12:11:04 : Treatment for anxiety? Need help deciding! : CineMike84 : https://www.reddit.com/r/rtms/comments/jukygk/treatment_for_anxiety_need_help_deciding/

So I originally signed up with a NeuroStar Transformations TMS location for depression. I had a difficult diagnosis and sunk into the deepest depression I’ve ever experienced and was desperate. Now though my situation has changed and I’m no longer in the deepest depths of that crippling hopelessness. My main issue has now become more crippling anxiety about my situation. I’m not hopeless and can enjoy certain things again but I can’t stop obsessing over fears and what if’s. My first appointment scheduled for TMS is for this week and now I’m debating whether or not I should still do it. I know TMS is more for depression but I have read that it can be therapeutic for OCD and anxiety when used with a right sided protocol, theta burst stimulation. 

So now that I’m out of depression should I cancel the treatment or should I just repurpose it to treat my anxiety instead? Does anyone have experience with using this treatment for anxiety? Would the benefits be worth it? Tell me your thoughts and experiences if you have please.

2020-11-15 12:10:59 : Crafted SMP [Semi-vanilla] {Whitelist} {1.16.2} {20+} {No reset} : CraftedSMP : https://www.reddit.com/r/MCVanillaServers/comments/jukyfj/crafted_smp_semivanilla_whitelist_1162_20_no_reset/

Crafted SMP is home to a community of like minded, mature (20+) players who enjoy the vanilla game. We have some plug-ins to enhance the vanilla experience and to protect the server, but our ethos is to keep it simple.

What you can expect from us… Take a look at **🌐 [our website](https://crafted-smp.com)** and **🎞️ [video advert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU5sZk3phes)**

### Vanilla Gameplay

We are committed to being and staying a vanilla server. We have the typical quality of life improvements you might anticipate: One Player Sleep, Anti-Enderman Grief, Silence Mobs, Coordinates HUD, Double Shulker Shells and Dragon Drops Elytra… plus the following gameplay enhancements:

* Mob and Player head drops
* Custom armour stands
* Blaze &amp; Caves Advancement Expansion (extra advancements and rewards)
* Decorative Heads Database

All of these have been added to enhance the vanilla experience rather than change the fundamentals of the game.

### No Reset

Our world is here to stay, what you build today will be there tomorrow and the next day. Right from the start Crafted SMP has been committed to being a permanent world. This means you can take your time and enjoy the process rather than building against the clock and watching all your hard work fall into the void. Following a hugely successful birthday weekend filled with events, we're just entering our second year on the server. Our world still has plenty of room for new players, and we’re always open to exploring fresh ideas and allowing the world to grow with the community.

For the real adventurers out there, the world outside the soft border is yours to explore. This area is reset from time to time so it’s a great place to mine, find resources and host events.

### Community

This is the basis of our server, we are here to relax, have fun and make friends. We have weekly events to bring us together and get to know each other better. Our events committee works hard to mix things up with a variety of events such as community builds, challenge events, building contests, PvP events, minigames and ‘game nights’.

We believe every voice in the community counts. No significant changes happen to the server without input from the community and a community wide vote. Players that have been with us just a few days get the same vote as those that have been there since launch. Everyone is welcome to make suggestions or put forward an idea.

### Rules

There’s no restriction on what you can build and you are free to AFK to your heart’s content. You’re welcome to use visual and quality of life client mods too.

While we do have moderation and anti-griefing tools, as a close and trusting community we rely primarily on the honor system. As you would expect, treat everyone and their builds with respect. That means no griefing, no stealing and no pvp without consent. A full list of rules can be found on **🌐 [our website](https://crafted-smp.com)** and Discord.

### Server Information

* Location: Germany
* Type: Dedicated
* Memory: 64GB
* Plugins: CoreProtect / Dynmap (**🗺 [check it out](https://crafted-smp.com/server-map)**)

### Ready to join us on the next stage of our adventure?

We are looking for active community focused players to join us and help us keep building and enhancing our world. If that’s you, simply fill in the **📝 [application form](https://forms.gle/2scA4Diio8SNMZQj6)** and we’ll be in touch via Discord soon (remember to check and accept friend request). We look forward to playing with you :)

2020-11-15 12:11:30 : Crafted SMP [Semi-vanilla] {Whitelist} {1.16.2} {20+} {No reset} : CraftedSMP : https://www.reddit.com/r/mcservers/comments/jukymf/crafted_smp_semivanilla_whitelist_1162_20_no_reset/

Crafted SMP is home to a community of like minded, mature (20+) players who enjoy the vanilla game. We have some plug-ins to enhance the vanilla experience and to protect the server, but our ethos is to keep it simple.

What you can expect from us… Take a look at **🌐 [our website](https://crafted-smp.com)** and **🎞️ [video advert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU5sZk3phes)**

### Vanilla Gameplay

We are committed to being and staying a vanilla server. We have the typical quality of life improvements you might anticipate: One Player Sleep, Anti-Enderman Grief, Silence Mobs, Coordinates HUD, Double Shulker Shells and Dragon Drops Elytra… plus the following gameplay enhancements:

* Mob and Player head drops
* Custom armour stands
* Blaze &amp; Caves Advancement Expansion (extra advancements and rewards)
* Decorative Heads Database

All of these have been added to enhance the vanilla experience rather than change the fundamentals of the game.

### No Reset

Our world is here to stay, what you build today will be there tomorrow and the next day. Right from the start Crafted SMP has been committed to being a permanent world. This means you can take your time and enjoy the process rather than building against the clock and watching all your hard work fall into the void. Following a hugely successful birthday weekend filled with events, we're just entering our second year on the server. Our world still has plenty of room for new players, and we’re always open to exploring fresh ideas and allowing the world to grow with the community.

For the real adventurers out there, the world outside the soft border is yours to explore. This area is reset from time to time so it’s a great place to mine, find resources and host events.

### Community

This is the basis of our server, we are here to relax, have fun and make friends. We have weekly events to bring us together and get to know each other better. Our events committee works hard to mix things up with a variety of events such as community builds, challenge events, building contests, PvP events, minigames and ‘game nights’.

We believe every voice in the community counts. No significant changes happen to the server without input from the community and a community wide vote. Players that have been with us just a few days get the same vote as those that have been there since launch. Everyone is welcome to make suggestions or put forward an idea.

### Rules

There’s no restriction on what you can build and you are free to AFK to your heart’s content. You’re welcome to use visual and quality of life client mods too.

While we do have moderation and anti-griefing tools, as a close and trusting community we rely primarily on the honor system. As you would expect, treat everyone and their builds with respect. That means no griefing, no stealing and no pvp without consent. A full list of rules can be found on **🌐 [our website](https://crafted-smp.com)** and Discord.

### Server Information

* Location: Germany
* Type: Dedicated
* Memory: 64GB
* Plugins: CoreProtect / Dynmap (**🗺 [check it out](https://crafted-smp.com/server-map)**)

### Ready to join us on the next stage of our adventure?

We are looking for active community focused players to join us and help us keep building and enhancing our world. If that’s you, simply fill in the **📝 [application form](https://forms.gle/2scA4Diio8SNMZQj6)** and we’ll be in touch via Discord soon (remember to check and accept friend request). We look forward to playing with you :)

If you have any questions about your application, please contact our admin team, whose details can be found on the ‘Help’ page of our website (or here on reddit).

2020-11-15 12:11:43 : Screen doesn't turn on for notifications : chololololol : https://www.reddit.com/r/Note20/comments/jukypb/screen_doesnt_turn_on_for_notifications/

So I recently upgraded from a S8+ to the Note 20 Ultra, but for some reason my Note's screen doesn't turn on when I get a notification (most importantly, when I have an alarm). I double checked that I have edge lightning to be on for all apps, but the screen still never turns on by itself. Does the Note 20 simply not support screen wake for notifications like older Samsungs, or is this something in my settings?

2020-11-15 12:12:14 : Recommended pipeline for data processing : iamkucuk : https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/jukywa/recommended_pipeline_for_data_processing/

Hello traders! I need your suggestions for 2 usecases:

1. Assume you have shit load of data (which should not be that hard). The amount of data may range from 500 gb to 1 tb. The data is a classical time series data which easily applicable for algotrading. Statistical results (just like indicators and signals) should be calculated easily and fast enough. These results will contribute a desicion algorithm (just like backtesting).

The possible infrastructures I came up with this scenario is: TimescaleDB, InfluxDB and Arctic.

 2. Assume your data is a high frequency streaming data. You don't need to save all the data (just the data for the latest 1 week). You need to calculate some statistics near-realtime, and is dense enough to not keep it on ram (around 50 gb). What would your preferred pipeline be?

The possible infrastructures I came up with this scenario is: Spark.

Please keep in mind that I'm a total newbie.

Best.

I would like to get decimal input from user from Termite and store the input in R7 register. My code works fine I tested and observed correct output at R7. But when I run, after my q4convert is done I want it to return main as it should be. However, when the line

is executed, link register stores this line and keeps returning this line after q4convert.s reaches end with the following statement.

                POP     {R1,R4,R5,R6}
                BX      LR

My InChar.s, OutStr.s files are prewritten files by TexasInstrument. Hence there is nothing wrong with them.

OutStr prints a string located in memory. Starting address of string is passed to R5.

InChar stores characters in R5.

I'll be glad if someone can help me.

Hello, I'm Tom, 23 year old European that decided to give this subreddit a try. So I'll kick it off with some info about me.

I spend most of my day at home mostly due to the fact that I live on a countryside, which proved to be quite handy during this awful Corona time. Most of my days are the same, so don't expect any sort of crazy stories but I got a few funny ones. Average Joe would be the term to sum me up: videogames, books, music, Harry Potter, LOTR, Star Wars. Lately I've been keeping up with The Good Doctor, but I mostly watch old UK TV shows. Gaming wise, I'd say coop games are my absolute favourite alongside with fps and strategy games. Music wise I like rock and metal, favourite band is definitely ACDC, second close is Iron Maiden. Gonna pursue masters degree in History, sociology and education, so it'd cool if we shared some interests in that field.

What am I looking for: Someone EU or NA based, person interested in communicating (preferably via discord), person that games (not a necessity).

Feel free to message, I'm probably listening to music or reading a book. Have a nice day/night.

I'll make this post very short and clear.

My main games are Rainbow six siege, Apex and Dead by Daylight, as of recently GTA V. I also play some coop games that I do enjoy, willing to expand game list if you can recommend some good games.

If you play any of these games, feel free to send me a message. I'd like to point out that I'm not interested in joining any gaming groups or discord servers.

I'm using discord for in game communication so if ya decide to send me a message please do include your discord id. I'd prefer to play with Europe or North America based players, 18+, active gamer or a weekend gamer (you don't have to play 24/7).

That's pretty much it, wish you all a good day!

2020-11-15 12:12:37 : Issue with playing &amp; recording on Beta tapes on a Sanyo Beta VCR7200 : Route66Fan : https://www.reddit.com/r/Betamax/comments/jukz17/issue_with_playing_recording_on_beta_tapes_on_a/

I have a Sanyo Beta VCR 7200 that has a problem with playing tapes. I bought the VCR off of Ebay about a year ago &amp; when I first got it &amp; tried it out, I could sometimes get it to play &amp; record, however, after not using it for a year, I tried using it again &amp; now it doesn't want to work. It will turn on &amp; rewind &amp; fast forward tapes, but it won't play &amp; record anymore. I've tried replacing the belts &amp; one of the idler wheels, as well as, lubricating some of the moving parts, but it still won't work. I wonder if I might have to clean the tape path as, I later found out, one of the tapes, which I had also gotten off of Ebay, that I tried playing, as well as, rewinding &amp; fast forwarding in it had sticky shed syndrome &amp; I had noticed that there was flakes of magnetic oxide inside the VCR. How could I go about fixing &amp; cleaning the VCR? Please help, thank you.

Is this possible on their systems? From what I've read they can see your earnings, but would like clarification on this end.

I want to avoid the harassment that will be headed towards me and my employer trying to chase up their reward when I did all the hard work myself and would rather just ignore rather than sending an email threatening legal action to get them off my back.

I posted this a month ago and it didn't push through. Hoping it'll work out this time.

I'll be in Makati on Tuesday (Nov 17) and I'm dying for a good makeout session. (Urban Dictionary definition: Passionate kissing for an extended period of time. Usually involves tongue and can last anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours. Often also includes removal of certain items of clothing, dry humping, and touching/rubbing/groping of various parts of the body.)

I'm free after 1pm. Your car, your place, I'm not picky. Pasig/Taguig also acceptable in a pinch. I'm Covid-free and you should be too.

Me: overweight chinita with 38C tits, very very touch starved

You: any age, any body type, just be a dude with a dick I can rub against

Message me with your age, location, and if you have a car or a place. (If you take me to your place and eat me out, I will treat you to merienda and dinner lol) No to motels right now.  

No need for pics/small talk/personal info, all conversation will be through reddit PMs/DMs. Stay safe, y'all.

i hate my parents. they will always yell at me for the most dumb stuff. they always yell if i’m not smiling or if they catch me crying. today, they just kept coming into my room and yelled then left. they did this on repeat for hours. they love doing this thing where they yell at me for something they did and expect me to apologize and claim that they were the bigger person. i don’t apologize because i didn’t do anything. i would be doing homework and they would yell because they broke something or they messed up. but it’s always my damn fault. i’m always crying because of this. they hit and yell and do stuff that i don’t think i can even say. it’s so annoying how they always do this but still expect me to have a smile on my face and want to talk to them.

I can't visit another state to escape, I can't buy a car to progress in my life because that exposes me to COVID, which my grandparents would catch. I can't even sit near my girlfriend on her birthday, with masks on, because that makes them uncomfortable. I feel like I keep disappointing her.  I just can't "Push on" anymore.

2020-11-15 12:13:08 : Venting about my experience : PastelDoctor : https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/jukz8d/venting_about_my_experience/

Hi first of all I've never posted anything to reddit before. idk if it matters but context I'm 19f and gf is 20f.

Now I'm not sure if people would call it "cheating" but my partner of 6 years had kissed and received hickeys from a guy she liked. our relationship has been going for 6 years and the last few spent mostly long distance on and off. after this happened the first time she visited me and told me that they guy confessed to her and she didn't know who to choose. at the time she didn't tell me about the kissing so I had no clue. I was upset at the fact that she had to choose but I figured whatever choice she made would be best. That week I thought of her as the victim in this situation being torn between lovers. After choosing me she would cry for a while and told me to not talk to her because of how hurt she was. She told me not to talk to her about my feelings because she had to prioritise herself. at this stage I didn't know of the kissing so I sorta pushed it aside.

A day or so after I facetimed her and saw hickeys and was genuinely shocked, that's when I properly found out. She said she figured I had already assumed so and she had done more since she told me about her decision making because she thought of that time as a break of sorts? Which we never communicated at all. I had no clue she thought we were taking a break. After finding out, we had long conversation about it, I felt and still feel hurt that all along I was actually the "victim" in a sense having being semi cheated on if you'd call it that idk...  yet she pushed my feelings aside, at least it felt that way.

I found this out after she ultimately made her choice to be with me, and I love her so much I don't think I could be without her. I expressed that I may have trust issues now and she got a tad mad and essentially referenced that if that were the case we may have to split. This made me mad because to me it feels like she gave me these trust issues just to leave me for that trait she gave me. I'm mainly making this post as a vent I guess. I don't have any people to talk about this with so it can get overwhelming.

After our long chat that night of talking it through I felt a little better and pushed my emotions to the side a tad. I am still with her and I try not to think about it but when I do I feel so.. idk what the word is kinda heartbroken I guess, I never knew she had it in her. another part of me is unsure if my feelings are valid because It's not like she had sex just make outs and hickeys. I don't think I've given myself the time to be emotional about this so it keeps coming back into my mind and lowers my mood immensely. She is visiting soon and I'm nervous about how our interactions will be.

Thanks for reading if anyone has haha, sorry if there's any errors in this I'm not feeling it right now. I'm actually feeling really anxious about posting this.

Things that come naturally to NT people usually require a lot of hard work, endurance and trial and error in our relationships.
Maybe you have agreed on a new "to-do list" and it works, the new medication or therapy is working as intended, or the laundry has been done in a timely manner, ..
However small they are, it's important to keep track of the positive things in our relationships.

2020-11-15 12:13:18 : How to Guide - Make a Woman Squirt from GSpot Stimulation : Gingerley1 : https://www.reddit.com/r/sextips/comments/jukzaq/how_to_guide_make_a_woman_squirt_from_gspot/

Foreplay is key.  Lots of kissing and groping makes everything better.  A clit orgasm first makes her much more aroused, makes it much easier to locate the g spot, and greatly increases the chance of success.  Once she is nicely aroused start to feel around, and enter her with one finger.  Move around and spread her lubrication, remove the first and use a second finger now and get it lubricated.  Then enter her with both.  It’s best to get two fingers in, rather than just one, as you can stimulate a wider area.

Use your ring and middle finger. Hold your hand with the pointer and pinky finger extended straight and ring and middle finger at 90 degrees - the "rocker" position.  This position works best for the two handed approach discussed later on, and for squirting.  For oral sex fold your pointer and pinky finger up toward your palm.  For rotating your hand to stimulate the sides or bottom, again fold your other two fingers toward your palm.  Feel around, rub with the pads of your fingers in a come hither motion, circles, or figure eights. Watch for response to see what areas are best.  Start with light pressure and increase slowly, depending on the response you get.  Once you find spots she likes, rub more aggressively with good pressure. Remember to use  the pads down the full length of the finger, rather than the tips. Try for maximum contact, 3-5 lbs pressure ( pick up a dumbbell with just finger tips to gauge this. It’s surprisingly a lot).

Areas to target include (with her on her back) the top area where the g spot is located, the sides, and the bottom.  For top and sides use the rubbing and circular motions.  For the bottom do that, plus try tapping down with fingers straight.  Change it up from time to time.  Try to rub all areas at least a little bit, to wake up all the nerve endings.  After she has had one or more g spot orgasms rubbing the sides and bottom can be quite pleasurable.

Her pubic bone may feel like a kind of plateau with a gentle ridge down the middle. Picture an upside down turtle shell.  Rub anywhere on there with the pads of the fingers, not the tips.  The g spot may be more of an area than a spot, and may not be in the center.  Some women get engorged and their spot may feel like a rough patch, or grains of rice. Try different depths until your find an area she responds to.  If hers is very deep you may have to reach as far as you can, which will require you to curl your fingers to reach up at the end of her pubic bone.  That far in it is necessary to use the finger tips rather than the pads.

Different approaches can be used, depending on how your lady responds.  Some women like stroking the g spot with a come hither motion until they orgasm.  Try this with her using a vibrator and you sucking on one nipple - it's explosive.  Some like it a bit more aggressive.  If she responds to rubbing a spot try tapping on it. Depending on her response, try getting aggressive with the  two finger tapping motion. With the rocker hand position, fingers all the way inserted, the inner pads on your finger segments all in contact with her pubic bone, move your hand up and down (not in and out) to put cyclic pressure on her spots with the flat pads of your fingers.  Not too much at first because it can be really intense. Start with short bursts to see how she responds.  Pause and rub her legs or mound, etc. then go back to it.  Experiment with different amounts of force.  Some women don't like much pressure.  Others can take literally all you can do.

To emphasize greater pleasure, and greater chance of squirting, put a pillow under her hips to tilt her pelvis forward.  Use your other hand to press gently down just above the mound.  This pushes her inner parts forward and down where they can be reached easier. Tell her to breathe. Use the rocker hand position and aggressively pump your hand up and down.  When she feels it build up have her push out. Most women clamp up at this point.  Tell them they need to push. You will know you are doing it right if you hear a fwap fwap fwap type sound.  If you position your hand so the palm is more like 120 degrees to your inserted fingers then the motion acts to pull on her inner parts with each stroke, which can greatly increase the chance of her squirting.  For expert level, you can make her squirt  rain on her  face by curling the palm back up a bit once she starts to flow. You can use the slapping motion of your palm to splash fluid up her body.

Try different approaches when pumping your hand to see what works.  Try fingers more or less straight.  Try with them curled up to follow the curvature of her pubic bone.  Try letting the bottoms of your fingers either go partway down (i.e. not trying to hit the bottom ), or purposely tapping both top and bottom with each stroke.  See what gets the best response.

While doing any of these moves, to reach the A spot (anterior fornix), try to go in really deep, past the backside of the pubic bone where it curves up out of reach. If your fingers are long or lady is not deep, with fingers straight you can just feel her cervix with the tips (feels like a little volcano shaped mound) and a soft fleshy spot between the cervix and back end of the pubic bone.  That fleshy area is the A spot.  When she starts to come you can often feel this part push forward to where you can reach it with your fingers.  Pushing her lower stomach with the other hand aids this greatly. When she is in the midst of a g spot orgasm if you can continue to pump your hand and waggle your fingertips back and forth across the A spot there is a good chance you'll drive her wild.s

Hello, I'm Tom, 22 year old European that decided to give this subreddit a try. So I'll kick it off with some info about me.

I spend most of my day at home mostly due to the fact that I live on a countryside, which proved to be quite handy during this awful Corona time. Most of my days are the same, so don't expect any sort of crazy stories but I got a few funny ones. Average Joe would be the term to sum me up: videogames, books, music, Harry Potter, LOTR, Star Wars. Lately I've been keeping up with The Good Doctor, but I mostly watch old UK TV shows. Gaming wise, I'd say coop games are my absolute favourite alongside with fps and strategy games. Music wise I like rock and metal, favourite band is definitely ACDC, second close is Iron Maiden. Gonna pursue masters degree in History, sociology and education, so it'd cool if we shared some interests in that field.

What am I looking for: Someone EU or NA based, person interested in communicating (preferably via some other platform), person that games (not a necessity).

Feel free to message, I'm probably listening to music or reading a book. Have a nice day/night.

2020-11-15 12:14:02 : AskReddit shouldn't have removed the "ask a r*pist" thread back in 2012 : OfficialMarkZuck : https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/jukzjk/askreddit_shouldnt_have_removed_the_ask_a_rpist/

For those who don't know about this, back in mid-2012, on AskReddit, there was a thread that was essentially "ask a r\*pist". Many r\*pists shared their stories, and there was a lot of very interesting discussion on it. Sadly, however, the entire thread and all the comments in it got entirely nuked, which was a major loss.

Yes, I know it's a horrible thing that can be triggering to many, but still, it was a rare chance for honest discussion of a taboo topic. They should have just removed any comments that encouraged r\*pe, and left the thread alone.

* The thread was used for research in multiple studies
* The thread gave a rare opportunity to hear the other side of the story

Then some psychiatrist made a thread calling it dangerous, based on what he admitted were theories that had never been tested, despite the fact that many r\*pe victims and advocates, including Gloria Allred and Jezebel, thought that the thread was a valuable thing.

It's probably too late to restore it now, but just some food for thought.

2020-11-15 12:14:38 : I think the stoic preach of differentiating between "what we can change and what we can’t" is not only a great lesson for acceptance, but a tremendous motivator as well : Idervas : https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/jukzte/i_think_the_stoic_preach_of_differentiating/

Now and then i see quotes and discussions about the topic of "what is under our control" and most of the time, people really talk over accepting what is not under our control. While I think this is a very solid message for itself, the part about identifying what is under our control and what we can change is another important task for self-improvement.

The moment you let go of things which you know you can't control, you can focus over things you can. Usually i see this aplication as self acceptance ("you can't control if it will rain tomorrow but you can control how you will feel about the rain"). Again, while i feel this is a valuable lesson, there can be a lot of other things you can change about the issue other than just you reaction to it. 

From the moment i started let go of what i can't control, i saw there is a LOT of things i can control. Usually we don't percive this because we are so immersed in our own rumination about things we cannot change. There is also the fact that most of times the path of changing things is a arduous one, but hard or not, it is whitin our power to walk it over.

I'm sorry if my reasoning sounds to you like a cheap motivotional message, but for me stoicism is also a lesson about doing all we can in the most virtous way


“Do not think that what is hard for you to master is humanly impossible; and if it is humanly possible, consider it to be within your reach.”

As I sit and watch the sunrise this AM I thought to check the kids wish lists... thinking are the items to expensive? Are they resonible and gifts someone would purchase to help make their Christmas magical. So I went to look at the lists and it says something was purchased from both lists!! I teared up, and I tear up more as I write this. The changes I made to better my children's lives is beneficial for their education and safety but has definitely cut into the money aspect. Im greatly appreciative and am so excited to receive the packages!!! Thank you to whomever purchased them!! As I wipe the tears of gratitude away I smile knowing there are good people everywhere 💞
